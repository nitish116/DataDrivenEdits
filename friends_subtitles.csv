10,1,90,"00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,579",This is the listening side of the wall.
10,1,91,"00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,849",Then she told methat she and Joey had broken up...
10,1,92,"00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,454",...and part of the reasonwas she had feelings for me.
10,1,93,"00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,935",Right. Yeah.
10,1,94,"00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,052",You know I've wanted to ask Charlieout since the day I met her.
10,1,95,"00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,616","Oh, I know, I know.That's been really hard for you."
10,1,96,"00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,692","Anyway, one thing led to another, and..."
10,1,97,"00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,976","...before you know it, we were kissing."
10,1,98,"00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,370",How angry do you thinkJoey's gonna be?
10,1,99,"00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,210","That is hard to say, Ross.That is hard to say."
10,1,100,"00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,370",I gotta find him.He's gotta be here someplace.
10,1,101,"00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,013",You would think.
10,1,102,"00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,292",Joey?
10,1,103,"00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,816",- Is he gone?- How are you doing this?
10,1,104,"00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,898",What? Hey!
10,1,105,"00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:17,291",What are you...? What is this?Have you been listening this entire time?
10,1,106,"00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,252",Yeah!
10,1,107,"00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,379","Now, what is this?"
10,1,108,"00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,618","What is this? Well, let's see.We kissed for 10 minutes..."
10,1,109,"00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:29,012","...and now we're talking to our friendsabout it, so I guess this is sixth grade."
10,1,110,"00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,490","No, no. Have you thoughtabout how complicated this could get?"
10,1,111,"00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,810","- What about Ross?- Well, he's with Charlie now."
10,1,112,"00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,410","Yeah, but he wants to talk to youbefore anything really happens with her."
10,1,113,"00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:42,255","And as his friend, I mean, don't youthink he deserves the same from you?"
10,1,114,"00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,011","You're a pain in my ass, Geller."
10,1,115,"00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,531","Look, we appreciate all the advice..."
10,1,116,"00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,055",...but this is between Joey and me.We can handle it.
10,1,117,"00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,451","We'll go. Will you do one thing for us,the people that care about you?"
10,1,118,"00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,451",- Sure.- Enunciate.
10,1,119,"00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,810",Get out!
10,1,120,"00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,491",Are they right?
10,1,121,"00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,334","Probably, yeah. I mean,maybe we should..."
10,1,122,"00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,297",...hold off until we talk to Ross.
10,1,123,"00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:22,128",Yeah. Yeah. We can wait.We don't have to do anything tonight.
10,1,124,"00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,853","Yeah, I think that would be best."
10,1,125,"00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,615","So, I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off."
10,1,126,"00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,975","- Although...- I like ""although."""
10,1,127,"00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,697","I mean, you know..."
10,1,128,"00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,091","Ross and I haven't dated in, like..."
10,1,129,"00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,978",...six years.
10,1,130,"00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,932",Six years?
10,1,131,"00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,611",Wow. That's almost as longas high school.
10,1,132,"00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,132","Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now."
10,1,133,"00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,773",Absolutely.

10,1,143,"00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,778",I can't seem to get Rossout of my head.
10,1,144,"00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,050","Well, maybe I can help."
10,1,145,"00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,697",Your lips are so soft. Do that again.

10,1,166,"00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,814",I think I can see your scalp.
10,1,167,"00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,178",Don't you just love it?
10,1,168,"00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,138","Yeah. Yeah, you got shellfishin your head."
10,1,169,"00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,616","It's something. You go, girlfriend."
10,1,170,"00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,216",- You never said that in your life.- Not once.
10,1,171,"00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,656","- I thought so.- Oh, and listen to this."
10,1,172,"00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,453",What do you know? It's a treatfor the eyes and the ears.
10,1,173,"00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,771","Wow, it's kind of weird that I'msitting next to Charlie after we broke up."
10,1,174,"00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,609",Yeah. It's almost as if Air Barbadosdoesn't care about your social life.
10,1,175,"00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,809",Does someone mind switchingand sitting with Charlie?
10,1,176,"00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:46,814","Oh, I mean, l... Dude, I spentthe whole conference with Charlie."
10,1,177,"00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,413","- I understand.- No, I'll do it."
10,1,178,"00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,455",Wish I could switch. I really don't wantto sit with Allen Iverson over there.
10,1,179,"00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,337",Once we're in the air and thecaptain turns off the seat belt sign...
10,1,180,"00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,458",...you feel free to roam about my cabin.
10,1,181,"00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,779",And you should be carefulwhen checking your overhead bins.
10,1,182,"00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,171","- Because items may shift during...- Oh, you're not good at this."
10,1,183,"00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,812","- Do you have to go home tonight?- No, I think I could come over."
10,1,184,"00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,299","It's Saturday, right?"
10,1,185,"00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,694",What?
10,1,186,"00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,409",- I can't do anything tonight.- Why not?
10,1,187,"00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,577",I have a date.
10,1,188,"00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:37,300","- You have a date? With who?- Oh, it's my girlfriend."

10,1,190,"00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,019","Well, when you and I broke up,I started seeing someone."
10,1,191,"00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:46,654","- Well, for how long?- Three months."
10,1,192,"00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,418",Three months?
10,1,193,"00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,893",Okay.
10,1,194,"00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,736","This is none of my business, but howlong are you gonna keep seeing her?"
10,1,195,"00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,973",I'll tell her that it's overtonight at dinner. I promise.
10,1,196,"00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,614","Oh, okay, good. You do that."
10,1,197,"00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,811","When you get home, maybe there'll be aspecial delivery package waiting for you."
10,1,198,"00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,771","Maybe I'll sign for it, tear it open."
10,1,199,"00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,579",- Pull out the packing material...- We'll have sex. Let's leave it there.
10,1,200,"00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,330","All right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey.I think this is the right time."
10,1,201,"00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,612","He's in a good mood afterthe flight attendant says ""duty-free."""
10,1,202,"00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,097",Okay. Good luck.
10,1,203,"00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,897",Ross is coming over. I think nowwould be a good time to talk to him.
10,1,204,"00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,129",I guess so. I'm just...I'm really nervous.
10,1,205,"00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,689","Well, keep in mindthat by the time you're done..."
10,1,206,"00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,499",...they'll probably be serving dinner.
10,1,207,"00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,212",Still nervous?
10,1,208,"00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,294",I'm gonna get the lasagna.
10,1,209,"00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,539","- Hey, Rach?- Yeah?"

10,1,252,"00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,457",I couldn't. He was saying allthese really nice things about me.
10,1,253,"00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,772",I didn't want him to get mad and takethem back. I'm gonna edge out Chandler!

10,1,258,"00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:22,535","You know, I'm just gonna take offand break up with her over the phone."
10,1,259,"00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,130","You can't do that. Oh, come on, Mike,strap on a pair."
10,1,260,"00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:32,656",Why don't you tell her that we got backtogether. Women appreciate honesty.
10,1,261,"00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,848","We also appreciate gentle spankingonce in a while, just FYI."
10,1,262,"00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,417",One more thing. There might be a pictureof Precious on my coffee table.

10,1,264,"00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,137","Is she a pure breed,or did you pick her up at the pound?"

10,1,275,"00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,730","You like that, right?"
10,1,276,"00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,612","- What are you singing?- It's ""Bolero"" from <i>10.</i>"
10,1,277,"00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,573","It's ""Ride of the Valkyries""from <i>Apocalypse Now.</i>"

10,1,331,"00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,815",He didn't know. He wasn't planning oncoming to Barbados and proposing to me.

10,1,336,"00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,338",He proposed to mewhile he was still seeing you.
10,1,337,"00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,134",He was gonna break up with youon your birthday?
10,1,338,"00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:25,896","I don't like to kiss and tell, buthe cheated on you a lot this weekend."
10,1,339,"00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,217","Oh, my God, you know, maybeyou're right. Maybe I don't need him."

10,1,347,"00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:09,299","Well, I was dancing aroundand singing ""No Woman, No Cry""..."
10,1,348,"00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,256",...and I got stuck.
10,1,349,"00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:17,096","- You can't move at all?- Oh, I can move."
10,1,350,"00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:25,773","If I untangle you, will you pleaseget rid of the cornrows?"
10,1,351,"00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,857",I guess so.

10,1,357,"00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,496","I think it's better if you tell him.You know, it's easier for a woman."
10,1,358,"00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,618","That way, you know, if he gets mad,all you have to do is go:"

10,2,95,"00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,698",- Hi.- Hey.
10,2,96,"00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,054",So...
10,2,97,"00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,888","...dreading this?- Oh, you bet."
10,2,98,"00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,895",So did you bringa little something for Ross?
10,2,99,"00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,530","Actually, it's some stuff you leftat my apartment."
10,2,100,"00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,330","Well, thanks."
10,2,101,"00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,929",And you can just give memy stuff whenever you want.
10,2,102,"00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,736","Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out."
10,2,103,"00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,658",I thought I heard voices.
10,2,104,"00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,533","Hi, Charlie."
10,2,105,"00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,175","Hey, Joey."
10,2,106,"00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,334","And, oh, you're gonna haveto introduce me to your new girlfriend."
10,2,107,"00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,052",I'm just kidding. I know Rachel.I know...
10,2,108,"00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,656",Come. Please come in.Come in.
10,2,109,"00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,970","Okay.Well, we brought you some wine."
10,2,110,"00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,611",That is so thoughtful.
10,2,111,"00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,890",She's a keeper.
10,2,112,"00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,973","- And what did you bring me, huh?- Actually, that's..."
10,2,113,"00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,091","Underwear, a toothbrush..."
10,2,114,"00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,296",...and a Van Halen CD.
10,2,115,"00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,974",I can use all these things!
10,2,116,"00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,535","Gosh, Ross, you know,you seem a little..."
10,2,117,"00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,015",What? Fine? Because I am.
10,2,118,"00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,410",Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't...?You see?
10,2,119,"00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,616",Who else is fine?
10,2,120,"00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,494",Come on.
10,2,121,"00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,658",Listen. Why don't you try to relax.Maybe have a drink.
10,2,122,"00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,617","You know what,that is a very good idea."
10,2,123,"00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,294",I'm gonna go makea pitcher of margaritas.
10,2,124,"00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,298","Oh, God."
10,2,125,"00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,172",So adorable.
10,2,126,"00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,173","Look at them,sleeping there like angels."
10,2,127,"00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,935","Yeah, I really cherishthese moments..."
10,2,128,"00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,490","...because before you know it,they're gonna be awake again."
10,2,129,"00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,850","Well, they may be a handful..."
10,2,130,"00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,931",...but they're so cute.- Yeah.
10,2,131,"00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,615","Oh, God, last time I babysat them,they did the funniest thing."
10,2,132,"00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,778",I haven't slept in four years.
10,2,133,"00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,690",That's a long time.
10,2,134,"00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,055","You just don't knowhow hard it is, Phoebe."
10,2,135,"00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,978",There's just so many of them.
10,2,136,"00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,732","You know, two I could handle."
10,2,137,"00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,334",Two's great.You just hold one in each hand.
10,2,138,"00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,731",What do I do when the third one runsat me with his bike helmet on?
10,2,139,"00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,619",I got no more handsto protect my area.
10,2,140,"00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,650","There's three of them, Phoebe.Three."
10,2,141,"00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,849","Yeah, I know, Frank."
10,2,142,"00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,171",I counted them when theywere coming out of my area.
10,2,143,"00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,374","Sometimes, I think that..."
10,2,144,"00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,973","Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it.It's too horrible. No."
10,2,145,"00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,694",What?
10,2,146,"00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,936","No, no, I can't."
10,2,147,"00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,488","Oh, my God, Frank.Are you thinking of leaving?"
10,2,148,"00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,697",Because I didn't have those tripletsso you could run out on them.
10,2,149,"00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,051","Oh, no, I would never do that.No. I just..."
10,2,150,"00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,528","...was thinking that, you know,maybe you could take one."
10,2,151,"00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,458",What?
10,2,152,"00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,775","You can't separate them, that's terrible!Which one?"
10,2,153,"00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,059",Thank you so much for seeing us.
10,2,154,"00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,336",Phoebe has told us great thingsabout you guys.
10,2,155,"00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,058","Please, we're happy to help."
10,2,156,"00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,729",We went through the same thingwhen we were adopting.
10,2,157,"00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,859","So a lot of malfunctioning wee-weesand hoo-hoos in this room, huh?"
10,2,158,"00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,139","I mean, you have a lovely home."
10,2,159,"00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,491",We appreciate anythingyou can tell us.
10,2,160,"00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,970","Well, actually,I think this might help."
10,2,161,"00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,169",It's pretty much...
10,2,162,"00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,410","...all the information you need.- Oh, my God."
10,2,163,"00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,299","Everything is broken into categories,then cross-referenced."
10,2,164,"00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,179",Then color-coded to correspondwith the forms in the back.
10,2,165,"00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,415",Thank you.
10,2,166,"00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,816",I think I just had a tiny orgasm.
10,2,167,"00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,136","I know the process is frustrating,but it's so worth it."
10,2,168,"00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,258",Adopting Owen was the best thingthat ever happened to us.
10,2,169,"00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,610",That's great. Can I see the book?
10,2,170,"00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,692","You want me to washmy hands first, don't you?"
10,2,171,"00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,818",Please. It's just so pretty and white.
10,2,172,"00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,975",Bathroom is down the hall to your left.
10,2,173,"00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,658",I would have told him to do it too.
10,2,174,"00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,851",Can I adopt you?
10,2,175,"00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,130","- Hey, you must be Owen.- Yeah."
10,2,176,"00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,695","I'm Chandler.Hey, I was in the Scouts too."
10,2,177,"00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,370","- You were?- In fact, my father was a den mother."
10,2,178,"00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,892",You know how to use a compass?
10,2,179,"00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,534",I have a badge in it.
10,2,180,"00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,856",- You do? That's fantastic.- You want to see it?
10,2,181,"00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,335","I'd love to, but I gotta get backto your parents."
10,2,182,"00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,695",They're telling usabout how they adopted you.
10,2,183,"00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,418",What?
10,2,184,"00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,698",What?
10,2,185,"00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,974",I'm adopted?
10,2,186,"00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,136",I got nothing.
10,2,187,"00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:03,732","Well, that first batch of margaritaswas not so great..."
10,2,188,"00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,216",...but this second batch is good.
10,2,189,"00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,057","Well, maybe the next batch,we could all get some."
10,2,190,"00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,490","Oh, God, this is fun, isn't it?"
10,2,191,"00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,855","You know, just the four of us."
10,2,192,"00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,772",Just hanging.
10,2,193,"00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,818","Dude, are you okay?"
10,2,194,"00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,811",And when are the fajitasgonna be ready?
10,2,195,"00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,178","I'm fine, okay? I'm great."
10,2,196,"00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,173",I'm just...I'm just proud of us.
10,2,197,"00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,650","You know?There's no weirdness, no tension."
10,2,198,"00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,771",No awareness.
10,2,199,"00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,693",We make a great foursome.We should do more stuff together.
10,2,200,"00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,457",Let's take a trip!
10,2,201,"00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,614","Okay, where do you think we can go?"
10,2,202,"00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,896",My fajitas!
10,2,203,"00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,532","Look, Charlie,I just want you to know..."
10,2,204,"00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,773",...Ross is just having a little troubleadjusting to the thought of Joey and me.
10,2,205,"00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,130","You know, he normallydoesn't drink like this."
10,2,206,"00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,457","You know what, this is nothing.My father is a raging alcoholic."
10,2,207,"00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,580","I'm sorry, have I madethis evening uncomfortable?"
10,2,208,"00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,812",Fajitas! Be careful!Very hot plate! Very hot!
10,2,209,"00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,931","Ross, you don'teven have oven mitts on."
10,2,210,"00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,013",That is gonna hurt tomorrow.
10,2,211,"00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,333","Okay, well, this is crazy."
10,2,212,"00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,896","We can't seriously be talking about metaking one of your kids, can we?"
10,2,213,"00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,573","Oh, no, of course we're not."
10,2,214,"00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,332",- That's insane.- I know.
10,2,215,"00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,899",Alice would never go for it.
10,2,216,"00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,172",She's pretty tired too.I think we could get her on board.
10,2,217,"00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,972","Well, just for argument's sake,you know, hypothetically..."
10,2,218,"00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,176",...which onewould you be willing to give up?
10,2,219,"00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,772",Frank Jr. Jr.?
10,2,220,"00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,210",You'd be getting a really good one.
10,2,221,"00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,974","I mean, you know,he's really funny."
10,2,222,"00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:01,689","Like, the other day,he made up this joke:"
10,2,223,"00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,058","What's green and says,""Hey, I'm a frog""?"
10,2,224,"00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,496",A talking frog.
10,2,225,"00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,697","Oh, no, you can't have him,he's too funny."
10,2,226,"00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,253","Well, all right, that's fine.What about Leslie?"
10,2,227,"00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,496","Oh, no, no, not Leslie. No."
10,2,228,"00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,209",She's the only one that knows howto burp the alphabet.
10,2,229,"00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,138","All right, so that leaves Chandler."
10,2,230,"00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,412","No, no, you can't have Chandler.No, no. She's my little genius."
10,2,231,"00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,019",I got big hopes for her.
10,2,232,"00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,775",She's gonna be a doctoror a realtor.
10,2,233,"00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,009","Wow, Frank,I think we just ran out of kids."
10,2,234,"00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,131","Oh, I think you're right."
10,2,235,"00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,451","Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't thinkI can give one of them up."
10,2,236,"00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,215","I mean, you know, they drive me crazy,but they're my babies."
10,2,237,"00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,777","I'm sorry, Frank,I didn't realize things were so bad."
10,2,238,"00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,057","You know, I'll help out more.I can babysit anytime you want."
10,2,239,"00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,812",You name the day and I'll be there.
10,2,240,"00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,255","- How about tomorrow?- Well, that's not good."
10,2,241,"00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,212",But I can move some stuff aroundand I'll be there.
10,2,242,"00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,496",You and Alice just takethe whole day together.
10,2,243,"00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,571",You'd do that for us?
10,2,244,"00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,930",Are you kidding?That's what sisters are for.
10,2,245,"00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,015","Oh, look at them."
10,2,246,"00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,779",I love you so much.
10,2,247,"00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,332","Oh, crap, don't wake up!Don't wake up!"
10,2,248,"00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,132","- Where are Bill and Colleen?- Kitchen, getting something to eat."
10,2,249,"00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,813",Can you believehow nice they are?
10,2,250,"00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,208",We have to leave.
10,2,251,"00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,573",Why?What did you do in the bathroom?
10,2,252,"00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,459",I didn't get to the bathroom.I bumped into Owen on the way.
10,2,253,"00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,214",He didn't know he was adopted.There's a slight chance...
10,2,254,"00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,699",...I may have told him.
10,2,255,"00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,257","Oh, my God, where's my purse?No, I can replace everything in there."
10,2,256,"00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,729",- Get that binder and let's go!- Hi.
10,2,257,"00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,337",Some little snacks for everybody.
10,2,258,"00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,378",You don't have to eat the sour worms.Those are for Owen.
10,2,259,"00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,373",I'll go get him in a second.
10,2,260,"00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,777","By the way, you should know,we haven't told him he's adopted yet."
10,2,261,"00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,536",But kids are so intuitive.
10,2,262,"00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,930","Don't you think, on some level,he already knows?"
10,2,263,"00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,337",- I'm adopted?- See? Intuitive.
10,2,264,"00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,771",What? Where did you hear that?
10,2,265,"00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,049",He told me.
10,2,266,"00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,010",And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.
10,2,267,"00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,094","Which, technically,now you should give back."
10,2,268,"00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,809",You told him he's adopted?
10,2,269,"00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,574",I'm sorry. You should havea sign out there or something.
10,2,270,"00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,777",Or at least whisper it to peoplewhen they come in the door.
10,2,271,"00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,296","""Owen doesn't know he's adopted,and he also thinks Santa is real."""
10,2,272,"00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,172",He isn't?
10,2,273,"00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,575","We have to get out of here, baby."
10,2,274,"00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,890","Everyone, I would liketo make a toast..."
10,2,275,"00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,853",...to Rachel and Joey.
10,2,276,"00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:05,698",And to love.
10,2,277,"00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,619","Ah, love!"
10,2,278,"00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,815",L-O-V-E. Love.
10,2,279,"00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,016","L is for ""life."""
10,2,280,"00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,648",And what is life without love?
10,2,281,"00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,134","Oh, my God, are we supposedto answer?"
10,2,282,"00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,697",O is for:
10,2,283,"00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,690","""Oh, wow!"""
10,2,284,"00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,936",The V is for this...
10,2,285,"00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,934",...very surprising turn of events...
10,2,286,"00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,656","...which I am still fine with,by the way."
10,2,287,"00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,371",E...
10,2,288,"00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,778",...is for how...
10,2,289,"00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,728",...extremely normal I find it...
10,2,290,"00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,936",...that you two...
10,2,291,"00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,334",...are together.
10,2,292,"00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,776",And that one dayyou might get married...
10,2,293,"00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,738",...and have children of your own.
10,2,294,"00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:17,611","- Dude, are you okay?- Totally."
10,2,295,"00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,899","Ross, you don't seem okay."
10,2,296,"00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,410","I'm sorry, it must bethe pressure of entertaining."
10,2,297,"00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,290",I think everyone wouldfeel better if we had some flan.
10,2,298,"00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,971","Wait, Ross. Ross, l...I have to take off."
10,2,299,"00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,818",- No!- I'm sorry.
10,2,300,"00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,289",I have an early class in the morning.
10,2,301,"00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,055",But this has been lovely.
10,2,302,"00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,659",Wasn't it? And you thought itwould be awkward with Joey.
10,2,303,"00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,095",And that you neverreally liked Rachel.
10,2,304,"00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,258","You are on fire!I'll call you in the morning, okay?"
10,2,305,"00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,012",- Okay.- All right.
10,2,306,"00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,096","God, Rachel, what Ross just said,that's just..."
10,2,307,"00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,575",That's okay.Girls tend not to like me.
10,2,308,"00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,092",Fine.
10,2,309,"00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,769",Okay. I guess it's just flan for three.
10,2,310,"00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,611","Hey, that rhymes."
10,2,311,"00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,817","You know what, Ross,I think we're gonna take off too."
10,2,312,"00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,657","Of course. God, I'm so stupid."
10,2,313,"00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,299",You guys are a couple now.
10,2,314,"00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,815","I mean, you probablyjust want to be alone."
10,2,315,"00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,490","- No, it's just getting late...- It's fine. It's totally fine."
10,2,316,"00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,493",I've got plenty of margaritas.It's all good.

10,3,42,"00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,029",She's this girl who lived in the buildingbefore you did.
10,3,43,"00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,341",Then she moved to England andpicked up this fake British accent.
10,3,44,"00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,660","On the machine, this is her message:"
10,3,45,"00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:32,789","""Monica, darling, it's Amanda calling."""

10,3,47,"00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,629",Chandler gets pedicures.
10,3,48,"00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,380","Just so I know, how many moreof those can I expect?"
10,3,49,"00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,185",Know what Amanda saidwhen she called me?

10,3,59,"00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,700",Just ignore her callsand dodge her till she gets the point.
10,3,60,"00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,704","Well, I guess we could try that.But it seems so harsh."
10,3,61,"00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,465","- Have you ever done that?- No. Had it done to me, though."
10,3,62,"00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,782",Feels good.

10,3,69,"00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,904","When the spraying stops,count to five..."
10,3,70,"00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,949","...pat yourself to avoid drip marks,then turn to get your back. Got it?"
10,3,71,"00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,262","Spray, count, pat and turn.Spray, count and pat."
10,3,72,"00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,901","- You catch on quick.- Well, I have a Ph.D., so..."

10,3,76,"00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,061","- You never turned?- No! I barely got to ""three Mississippi""!"
10,3,77,"00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,620",Mississippi? I said count to five.
10,3,78,"00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,028",Mississippi-less-ly?
10,3,79,"00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,387","Well, how bad is it?"
10,3,80,"00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:03,747",Not that bad yet. But it getsdarker for the next four hours.
10,3,81,"00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,425",- So how dark will it get?- You got sprayed with two twos and...
10,3,82,"00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,421",I'm a four?

10,3,86,"00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,869","Wait a minute,there's no light on the back wall."
10,3,87,"00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,659",How do I knowwhen it's gonna start? Hello?
10,3,88,"00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,747",My eyes!
10,3,89,"00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,460",The same thing happened again!

10,3,99,"00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,303",Okay. Sorry.
10,3,100,"00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,620","I'm sorry. Again, I don't knowwhat happened. I must be nervous."
10,3,101,"00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,906",I don't get it. Chandler loved it.
10,3,102,"00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,539",I promise. I won't do it again.I really do. This is gonna be great.

10,3,106,"00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,580","Yeah, it could be Rachel askingif someone could babysit again."
10,3,107,"00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,225","- It could be Amanda.- Oh, you're right."
10,3,108,"00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,259",I was just kidding about Rachel.Babysitting's a gas.
10,3,109,"00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,782","<i>Hello, Monica.</i><i>It's Amanda calling again.</i>"

10,3,140,"00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,183",I'm an expert at taking off bras.I could do it with one hand.
10,3,141,"00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:21,262",I could do it with my eyes closed.Once I just looked at one...
10,3,142,"00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,546",...and it popped open.
10,3,143,"00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:27,983",- I blame your bra.- It's a standard-issue bra clasp.
10,3,144,"00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,149",Then I blame you. Yeah. That's right.You threw me off with all your slapping.
10,3,145,"00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,269","Okay, look, I'm really sorryabout that, Joey."
10,3,146,"00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:42,619","But do you think maybe, on some level,you don't want to take off my bra?"
10,3,147,"00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,060","No, I don't have another level."
10,3,148,"00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:03,618",Hold on. There's something different.
10,3,149,"00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:09,187",I went to that tanning placeyour wife suggested.
10,3,150,"00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:12,308",Was that place the sun?
10,3,151,"00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,701","Oh, and it gets worse."
10,3,152,"00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,868","Oh, my God, you can do a duetof ""Ebony and Ivory"" all by yourself."
10,3,153,"00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:28,024",How could you mess this up?It's so easy.
10,3,154,"00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,829","You go in the booth,count to five and turn around."
10,3,155,"00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,265","- How do you count to five?- One, two, three..."
10,3,156,"00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,783",Damn it!
10,3,157,"00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,423",I know!
10,3,158,"00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,268",What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?
10,3,159,"00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,028",How was your date with Joey?
10,3,160,"00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,581","Well, it was good,until we got back to our apartment."
10,3,161,"00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,265",And then we were fooling around andhe started to put his hand up my leg...
10,3,162,"00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,022",...and I kept slapping it away.
10,3,163,"00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,464",You didn't like that?
10,3,164,"00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,069","Well, it wasn't just me, all right?He freaked out too."
10,3,165,"00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,902",He couldn't even undo my bra.
10,3,166,"00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,341",Really? One time he just lookedat my bra and it popped open.
10,3,167,"00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,820",I do not know what's wrong with us.
10,3,168,"00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:16,220",We've kissed beforeand that's been great.
10,3,169,"00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,387",But this timeit was leading somewhere...
10,3,170,"00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,906",...and I was very aware of the factthat it was Joey touching me.
10,3,171,"00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,901",You guys have been friends forever.
10,3,172,"00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,504",The first time you kissed Rosswas weird.
10,3,173,"00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,628",You couldn't stop laughing.You got through that.
10,3,174,"00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:33,066","Okay. That's true.That's true, we can do this."
10,3,175,"00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,427",You're right. We can do this.We'll just power through.
10,3,176,"00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,706","Chandler, can I talk to youfor a second?"
10,3,177,"00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,340","No need, problem solved.We are powering through."
10,3,178,"00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,699","Chandler, stop.It's not going to pop open."
10,3,179,"00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,383",You don't know.
10,3,180,"00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,823","- Hi, Phoebe.- Hey."
10,3,181,"00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:01,140",- Is Amanda here yet?- No.
10,3,182,"00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,104","I'm sorry for screwing up that ""cuttingher out"" plan, but I have a new plan."
10,3,183,"00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:08,262",Chandler will call in a few minuteswith an emergency.
10,3,184,"00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,422","Okay, what kind of emergencygets us both out of here?"
10,3,185,"00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:15,139",What do you think of Mike and Chandlerbeing in a car accident?
10,3,186,"00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,309",- Are you kidding? I love it!- Okay.

10,3,238,"00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,105",It was right after wewere living together...

10,3,240,"00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,859",You were really controllingand compulsive and shrill.

10,3,242,"00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:54,701",You're also so generousand kind and scrappy.

10,4,46,"00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,006",What? What? It's for her hot friends.
10,4,47,"00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,206","When they see this, you'll be 52."
10,4,48,"00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,442",And starting to think aboutsettling down.

10,4,50,"00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,889",Love to. Yeah.
10,4,51,"00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:17,807",- We were supposed to bring presents?- Yeah. I wrote Emma a song.
10,4,52,"00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:20,165","Oh, yeah.How was I supposed to know?"
10,4,53,"00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:23,447","- Joey, it's a birthday party.- Yeah, but for a 1 -year-old."
10,4,54,"00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,001",What's the point? The other dayshe laughed for an hour at a cup.
10,4,55,"00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:31,845","Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it,dressed as a farmer."
10,4,56,"00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,482","And he's standing next to this cow,and the cow says, ""El-moo."""

10,4,59,"00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:51,243","- Where's the birthday girl?- Oh, she's still napping."
10,4,60,"00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,120",She was probably up all night excitedabout the party she knows is happening.
10,4,61,"00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,965","I know you guys really want to get toVermont, and this isn't a big deal to you."
10,4,62,"00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,964","But it really is to us, okay? Emmawill never have a first birthday again."
10,4,63,"00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,202",You're right. We're sorry.
10,4,64,"00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,565",Let's wake up Emmaand get the fun time started!
10,4,65,"00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,244","She didn't sleep well last night,so we can't wake her."
10,4,66,"00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,685","Are you frigging kidding me, Greene?"

10,4,70,"00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:28,523",Ross was jealous of all the attentionwe were giving you.
10,4,71,"00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,648",He pulled on his testicles so hard...
10,4,72,"00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:34,643",...we had to take himto the emergency room.
10,4,73,"00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,484",There's something you didn't knowabout your dad.
10,4,74,"00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,403","Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Geller.Let me help you with that."

10,4,77,"00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,562",If we gave this present to Emmafrom all of us.
10,4,78,"00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,883",Which one are you?
10,4,79,"00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:08,049",- I can't believe Emma's still asleep.- I know. What are we gonna do?
10,4,80,"00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,962",I've got a plan. I've got a plan.

10,4,83,"00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,880",I'm not going to Vermontwith this Monica.

10,4,85,"00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,801",I was thinkingsince you wrote a song...
10,4,86,"00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,803",...maybe I could do somethingfor Emma using my talents.
10,4,87,"00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,438",So you're gonna hit on her?
10,4,88,"00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:37,922","No, no, no. My talents as an actor."
10,4,89,"00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,126","You know, I could, like, maybe..."
10,4,90,"00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,487",I could do a dramatic readingof one of her books.
10,4,91,"00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,767",Or you could stick a fork in an apple.
10,4,92,"00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,406","- Hey, I think Emma might like it.- Oh, Emma might like what?"
10,4,93,"00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,004",- My present.- What did you get her?
10,4,94,"00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,809",- We prepared performances.- Separate performances.
10,4,95,"00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,120",But equally real.
10,4,96,"00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,121",That sounds like fun.

10,4,98,"00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,285",So would you mindperforming them once now?

10,4,201,"00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,840","All right, five more minutes."
10,4,202,"00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,728",Hello?
10,4,203,"00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,801","Oh, no, what happened?"
10,4,204,"00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,643","Okay, okay, where are you?"
10,4,205,"00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,846","Okay, I'll be right there."
10,4,206,"00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,523",Was that Emma? Is she up?
10,4,207,"00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,607",Rachel got pulled over for speeding.
10,4,208,"00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:43,125",She forgot her license.I have to bring it to her.
10,4,209,"00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:48,125","- lf you're leaving, I'm definitely going.- Wait, if anybody gets to go, it's us!"
10,4,210,"00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,360",We've been complaining the longest!
10,4,211,"00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:53,809","No, wait, you guys.No, you can't leave."
10,4,212,"00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:56,279",Rachel already feels badthat the cake's messed up.
10,4,213,"00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,487",How do you think she'll feelwhen she comes back and you're gone?
10,4,214,"00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,084",I don't know. You'll tell us on Monday.
10,4,215,"00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,039","Joey, you're in charge, okay?You make sure nobody leaves."
10,4,216,"00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,041",Got it!
10,4,217,"00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,121",Hey! Where do you thinkyou're going?
10,4,218,"00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,564",To the bathroom.
10,4,219,"00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:18,008","Well, the rest of you get comfortable,because we are gonna be here for a..."
10,4,220,"00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:23,119","- Wait, there's a window in there.- No! He's not getting away that easy!"
10,4,221,"00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,361",What are you doing?Get the hell out of here!
10,4,222,"00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,368","Well, that one did not haveEmma's face on it."
10,4,223,"00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,168","- No, it did not.- No."
10,4,224,"00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,281","Well, we'd better get going. It's late."
10,4,225,"00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,806",Jack can't drive at night anymore.He has trouble staying in his lane.
10,4,226,"00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:48,758",Last winter I went up on a church lawnand drove right through a manger scene.
10,4,227,"00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,160",The papers thought it wasa hate crime.
10,4,228,"00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,444","- Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.- Okay."
10,4,229,"00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,680","- Bye. Bye, dear.- Nighty-night."
10,4,230,"00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,966",- Nighty-night.- Bye.
10,4,231,"00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,644","- How could you just let them leave?- Hey, hey, hey."
10,4,232,"00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:08,519",I'm not gonna mess with Jack. He'sa great man. He fought for our country.
10,4,233,"00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:11,887","No, he didn't. He pretended to bea Quaker to get out of Korea."
10,4,234,"00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:18,285","Well, that's it. He's the last one to go.I'm locking you guys in."
10,4,235,"00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,840","You do know I can just turn themthe other way around, right?"
10,4,236,"00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,365","Oh, I forgot you used to live here."
10,4,237,"00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,918","- Hello?- Joey, it's Estelle."
10,4,238,"00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,162",- Hey.<i>- So how'd your audition go today?</i>
10,4,239,"00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,527",- What audition?- The one I told you about last week.
10,4,240,"00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:41,682",What? You never said anythingabout an audition.
10,4,241,"00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,602",Let me start over.I just got a call about an audition.
10,4,242,"00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,327",<i>I think you can still make it.</i>
10,4,243,"00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,278","It's down at the Astor Theater, and youneed to have a monologue prepared."
10,4,244,"00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,118",A monologue? I don't have a...
10,4,245,"00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,286",I got it.
10,4,246,"00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,326",So I'm gonna take off.
10,4,247,"00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:09,004","- What?- No, wait! You don't get to leave."
10,4,248,"00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,162",I've got a massage client waitingoutside my door any minute.
10,4,249,"00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,163",And we paid for a roomthat we're supposed to be in right now!
10,4,250,"00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,803","Well, okay, now..."
10,4,251,"00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,325",...only one of us has to staywith Emma.
10,4,252,"00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,723","Okay, and as the personwho realized that, I get to go."
10,4,253,"00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,721","No, no, no. No. No."
10,4,254,"00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,688",Let's figure out a fair wayto decide who's staying.
10,4,255,"00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:29,761","Oh, I got it."
10,4,256,"00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,888","Okay, everyone pick a number fromone to 10, all right?"
10,4,257,"00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:35,439",Whoever gets the highest numbergets to go first.
10,4,258,"00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,885","- Okay, 10.- Okay, Monica picks 10. I call nine."
10,4,259,"00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,324",Anyone else?
10,4,260,"00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,040","- No, let's just draw straws.- Okay."
10,4,261,"00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,440",Or we could flip a coinand multiply the answer...
10,4,262,"00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,044",- I'm begging you to stop.- Right.
10,4,263,"00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:53,566","Okay, how about this?We got wind-up toys for Emma."
10,4,264,"00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:56,961","We can make them race,and whoever comes in last stays."
10,4,265,"00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,286","Yeah, let's do that!"
10,4,266,"00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,249",That sounds more fun than the thingwe were gonna do in Vermont!
10,4,267,"00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,120","- Okay, everybody, pick your toys!- Okay. I want the dolphin!"
10,4,268,"00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,282",- That's a bear!- I'm too excited!
10,4,269,"00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,683","Phoebe, you get the bear.Joey, you get the robot."
10,4,270,"00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,806","- Oh, yeah.- And Chandler and I get the dog."
10,4,271,"00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,202",And the race is going to gofrom here to here.
10,4,272,"00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,487","Now, the one who comes in last stays!"
10,4,273,"00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,720","Okay, ladies and gentlemen,wind your toys."
10,4,274,"00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:28,929","- Okay. On your mark, get set, go!- Go! Go!"
10,4,275,"00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,365","Come on, robot!"
10,4,276,"00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,727",What are you barking at?
10,4,277,"00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,725","Well, how is that gonna help?"
10,4,278,"00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:46,719",I bought you! How did I forgetthat that's all you do?
10,4,279,"00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:49,120","Way to go, robot!"
10,4,280,"00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,839","Good job, Alan."
10,4,281,"00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,525","- Hey, good race, you guys.- Yeah, see you later."
10,4,282,"00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,601","No. No, no. Wait."
10,4,283,"00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,123",We didn't lose.
10,4,284,"00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,682",The rules clearly stated that the last oneto cross the finish line was the loser.
10,4,285,"00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,887","Well, our dog never crossedthe finish line. So technically..."
10,4,286,"00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,967",They left.
10,4,287,"00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,128",There isn't time to go to the bakery.We're gonna come home.
10,4,288,"00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,885",Everybody left?
10,4,289,"00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:24,565","All right. Well, just tell Emma thatwe'll be there as soon as we can. Bye."
10,4,290,"00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:27,321","- Rachel!- Oh, God, sorry!"
10,4,291,"00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,766",I can't believe they gave you a ticket.You're such a good driver.
10,4,292,"00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:35,721",- Emma's awake.- Yeah?
10,4,293,"00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,482",I can't believe this.
10,4,294,"00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,960","This is her first birthday, she's awake,we're not even there."
10,4,295,"00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,247",Everybody left. We still havethis stupid obscene cake.
10,4,296,"00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,800","Hey, maybe I can fix that. You know,try to turn it into something else."
10,4,297,"00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,530","Oh, don't even bother."
10,4,298,"00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,045",We've already ruinedher first birthday.
10,4,299,"00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:57,249","And do you know how important theseearly experiences are, Ross? Very!"
10,4,300,"00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,288",According to the back coverof that book that you gave me.
10,4,301,"00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,725","Rach, she's not gonna remember this."
10,4,302,"00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,842",I guess.
10,4,303,"00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:13,083","Oh, I just had such an idea of whatthis day would be like, you know?"
10,4,304,"00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,320",Emma laughing...
10,4,305,"00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,449","...and everybody gathered aroundher cake, singing ""Happy Birthday."""
10,4,306,"00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,280","And then we would all... Hey, get outof the road, you stupid student driver!"
10,4,307,"00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,884",They have to learn.
10,4,308,"00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,009",- Hey.- What?
10,4,309,"00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,206",This is not bad.
10,4,310,"00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:37,966","Oh, my God. Look, you made itinto a bunny. How did you do that?"
10,4,311,"00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:41,088","Well, I just made thesetwo things cheeks."
10,4,312,"00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,366",And then I split this to make ears.
10,4,313,"00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,040","Well, I am very impressed."
10,4,314,"00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,007","Some can sing, some can dance."
10,4,315,"00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,560","I, apparently, can turn phallic cakesinto woodland creatures."
10,4,316,"00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,128","Now, another way to organizeyour stuffed animals is by size."
10,4,317,"00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,168","I'm sorry, is this a game for Emmaor for Monica?"
10,4,318,"00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:06,922",Game?
10,4,319,"00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,288","Emma, do you even know it'syour birthday today? You're 1."
10,4,320,"00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,089",One year old. That's little.
10,4,321,"00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,960",That's my girl.
10,4,322,"00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,045",That's how old you are.
10,4,323,"00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:25,486",Did I teach her that?Did I just impart wisdom?
10,4,324,"00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,522",I want one.
10,4,325,"00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,641",Me too.
10,4,326,"00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,565",There's no one around.Why don't we just take this one?
10,4,327,"00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,046",- And head to Canada.- I was kidding.
10,4,328,"00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,609",I wasn't. Let's get going.
10,4,329,"00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,168","- Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?- No, not yet."
10,4,330,"00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,879","- Oh, good, I didn't miss the party.- What about your massage client?"
10,4,331,"00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:57,805","I just felt so bad missing this. So I justslipped him a little something, you know."
10,4,332,"00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,007","As long as I'm back in fiveor six hours, it'll be all right."
10,4,333,"00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,409",Okay.
10,4,334,"00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:08,643","If Ross and Rachel ask, I've beenhere the whole time. The whole time."
10,4,335,"00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,045",I've been here the whole time.
10,4,336,"00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,438","Joey, we just saw you come in.You ran past us on the stairs."
10,4,337,"00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,284","I don't care that you left. I'm just gladthat you're here. Thanks, you guys."
10,4,338,"00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:24,159","Hey, guys, come on. You gotta seewhat Emma just did."
10,4,339,"00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:26,480","- What?- Emma, how old are you?"
10,4,340,"00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,322",How old are you today?
10,4,341,"00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,127","Emma, that's right. You're that many."
10,4,342,"00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:37,850","Oh, my God, our daughter's a genius."
10,4,343,"00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,762",- This means...- No! No science camp!
10,4,344,"00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,367",Damn it! I'll put a candle on the cake.
10,4,345,"00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:51,082","Oh, and, Emma, look at yourstuffed animals lined up so neatly."
10,4,346,"00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,128",Thanks.

10,4,348,"00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:01,002",Emma's first birthday cake.
10,4,349,"00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,568","Go ahead, Emma,blow out the candle."
10,4,350,"00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,198","Come on, Emma. You can do it."
10,4,351,"00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,362","- What's wrong? Are you okay?- Oh, yeah, nothing."
10,4,352,"00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,964",These are happy tears.
10,4,353,"00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,280",This is just what I wanted.
10,4,354,"00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:17,607","Hey, you made it into a bunny."

10,5,199,"00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,250",I doubt that.Tell her about us last year.
10,5,200,"00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,534","Well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,and he wrote me a rap song."
10,5,201,"00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,055",- Seriously?- Word.
10,5,202,"00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,534",Mine was worse than that.
10,5,203,"00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,770","- Well, what happened?- We were at the game."
10,5,204,"00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,659",This guy proposed to his girlfriendon the big screen thing.
10,5,205,"00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,334","- That is so tacky.- Well, that's what I said."
10,5,206,"00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,016",But it turns out Mike was planning topropose to me that same way last night.
10,5,207,"00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,097","Oh, my God.Mike was gonna propose?"
10,5,208,"00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,336",- That's huge.- Do you want to marry him?
10,5,209,"00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,496","Yeah, I really do. Yes."
10,5,210,"00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,969",But after I dumped on the wayhe was gonna do it...
10,5,211,"00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:33,497","...I don't think he'll ever ask again.I said no in Barbados, and now this?"
10,5,212,"00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,333",She's right. If I were a guy and...
10,5,213,"00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,898","Did I just say, ""If I were a guy""?"
10,5,214,"00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,930",You don't need him to propose to you.Maybe you could propose to him.
10,5,215,"00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:51,610","Oh, I don't know. I don't know.Isn't that a little desperate?"
10,5,216,"00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,890",I proposed to Chandler.
10,5,217,"00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,377","All right, moving on."
10,5,218,"00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,975",I don't think it was desperate.It was amazing.
10,5,219,"00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,129",Thank you.
10,5,220,"00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,259","- Well, do you think I should propose?- I think it could be kind of great."
10,5,221,"00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,493",Absolutely. You'll love the feeling.There's nothing like it.
10,5,222,"00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,368",Okay. Okay.So how should I do it?
10,5,223,"00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,730",How about at a gameon the big screen?
10,5,224,"00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,298",How about at a Foot Locker?
10,5,225,"00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,259","What? What, he obviously thinksthat's a nice way to be proposed to."
10,5,226,"00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,856","- Plus, he'd never suspect it.- Yeah, that does make sense."
10,5,227,"00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,535","- Okay, now, would you two like that?- Sounds good to me."
10,5,228,"00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,850",But what would a guy think?
10,5,229,"00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,651",- Nana's on the phone.- Wow.
10,5,230,"00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,336","That's interesting,since she died seven years ago."
10,5,231,"00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,492",She did?
10,5,232,"00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,810",Who got her condo in Boca?
10,5,233,"00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,299",Hello?
10,5,234,"00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,091",It's our nanny.
10,5,235,"00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,619",Hi.
10,5,236,"00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:01,296","Oh, God, I hope you feel better.Okay. Bye."
10,5,237,"00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,132",That's Molly. She's sick.
10,5,238,"00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,292",- Can you watch Emma today?- I can't. I have back-to-back classes.
10,5,239,"00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,338",Did Molly say what she had?Because my throat's been hurting.
10,5,240,"00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,258",Menstrual cramps.
10,5,241,"00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,375",I don't think that's what this is.
10,5,242,"00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,179","- Can any of you watch Emma?- No, I'm sorry, sweetie."
10,5,243,"00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,099","No, I've got work,and then I'm proposing."
10,5,244,"00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,689",Great. Shoot.What am I gonna do?
10,5,245,"00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,652","Well, I could do it."
10,5,246,"00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,130","- Well, actually...- Can I talk to you for a second?"
10,5,247,"00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,573",I do not want her babysitting our child.
10,5,248,"00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,130","- Why not?- For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella."
10,5,249,"00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,491","- Ella's a nice name.- Fine, we'll call the next one Ella."
10,5,250,"00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,691",- The next one?- Okay.
10,5,251,"00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,489",I don't want her watching our baby.
10,5,252,"00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,732","Ross, I am trying to help herbecome a better person."
10,5,253,"00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,731",This is a huge breakthrough for her.
10,5,254,"00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,973",She just offered to do somethingfor another human being.
10,5,255,"00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,249","You know, I don't know."
10,5,256,"00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,614","Ross, I'm telling you..."
10,5,257,"00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,449","...she's giving up getting her eyebrowsshaped to do this, all right?"
10,5,258,"00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,169",Do you understand how importantthat is in our world?
10,5,259,"00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,250","Listen, I couldn't help but overhear,because I was trying to."
10,5,260,"00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,578","Listen, let me do this.I really want to help you guys out."
10,5,261,"00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,857","And plus, Rachel's beenso wonderful to me."
10,5,262,"00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,860","- Absolutely.- Oh, great!"
10,5,263,"00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,170",So how much does it pay?
10,5,264,"00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,410",How's the second draftof the letter coming?
10,5,265,"00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,777","Great. I'm finished. In fact,I just dropped it off at the agency."
10,5,266,"00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,173",- You dropped it off?- Yeah.
10,5,267,"00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,808",Can we read it?Can you print out another copy?
10,5,268,"00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,658","No can do, <i>amigo.</i>"
10,5,269,"00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,895","No, I didn't use the computer.It felt more personal to handwrite it."
10,5,270,"00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,691","- You handwrote it?- Yeah, and don't worry."
10,5,271,"00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,249",I didn't try to sound smart at all.
10,5,272,"00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,574",See you later.
10,5,273,"00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,289","Oh, my God. Oh, my God.That letter is gonna go in our file."
10,5,274,"00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,212",We're never gonna get a kid.
10,5,275,"00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,490",We're gonna beone of those old couples...
10,5,276,"00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,891",...that collects orchidsor has a lot of birds.
10,5,277,"00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,692",It's okay. You know what?
10,5,278,"00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,136",I will just call the agencyand tell them to throw out the letter.
10,5,279,"00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,779","Okay, good."
10,5,280,"00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,019","Hello, this is Chandler Bing."
10,5,281,"00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,298",Someone just dropped off a handwrittenrecommendation letter and...
10,5,282,"00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,329",Okay.
10,5,283,"00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,100",Thank you. Goodbye.
10,5,284,"00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,052","We're screwed, aren't we?"
10,5,285,"00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,814",You know what? Just tell meon the way to the bird store.
10,5,286,"00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,694",- They loved it.- What?
10,5,287,"00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,773",They thought it was very smart of usto have a child write the letter.
10,5,288,"00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,771",They thought Joey was a child?
10,5,289,"00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,858","She guessed 8, 9,based on his drawings."
10,5,290,"00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,295","- Hi.- Hey, what'd you guys do today?"
10,5,291,"00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,409","Ella wanted to go out, so we wentshopping and got some sushi."
10,5,292,"00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,812","- That sounds like fun.- Yeah, not really."
10,5,293,"00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,459",Babies are dull.
10,5,294,"00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,854","- Hey. Hi, how's my girl?- I'm fine."
10,5,295,"00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,329",And I got you a presentfor letting me stay with you.
10,5,296,"00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,458",- Ready?- Yeah.
10,5,297,"00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,177",You pierced her ears?
10,5,298,"00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,099",Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?
10,5,299,"00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,209",You pierced her ears?
10,5,300,"00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,695",How could you do thiswithout telling me?
10,5,301,"00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,415","If I had told you, then it wouldn'thave been a surprise, now would it?"
10,5,302,"00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,259",I think she looks cute.
10,5,303,"00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,096",But I am wrong.
10,5,304,"00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,098","Oh, my God. Oh, my God.Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out."
10,5,305,"00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,735","Why, did something happento his falafel cart?"
10,5,306,"00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,692","- Hey, guys.- Ross!"
10,5,307,"00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,614","Hi, Emma.Why is she wearing her hat so low?"
10,5,308,"00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,291",- She can barely see.- I don't really want her to see.
10,5,309,"00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,449",Why not?
10,5,310,"00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,180",Because there are so manyterrible sights in this world.

10,6,48,"00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,664",But I don't think you're right for this.The part's a stuffy college professor.
10,6,49,"00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,584","I can do that.Hello, I'm your professor."
10,6,50,"00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,187","When I'm not busy thinkingof important things, or professing..."

10,6,96,"00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:53,099",I'd take her in a minute.
10,6,97,"00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,261",But I think that you'regiving up too easy.
10,6,98,"00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,944",I think that you needto fight for her.
10,6,99,"00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,826","- Really, you think?- Absolutely."
10,6,100,"00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,749","You say to him, ""I'm sorry, Mike,I can't live without her."

10,6,103,"00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,180","Oh, wait. I just realized, if I do that,that means you don't get her."
10,6,104,"00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,267","Damn it, I did not think this through."
10,6,105,"00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,708","- Hey, guys.- Hi."
10,6,106,"00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,588","Oh, any word on casting yet?"

10,6,110,"00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:39,308","Look, come on, please? It's not likeI'm asking you for some crazy favor."
10,6,111,"00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,223",This is what I do for a living.I am a professional actor.
10,6,112,"00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,301","Man, I'm two hours late for work."
10,6,113,"00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,182",Here's my reel. It's got allthe commercials that I've been in.
10,6,114,"00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,948",- Joe...- Just watch it.
10,6,115,"00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,783","If you don't like it,don't pass it on to your bosses."

10,6,118,"00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,739",- What am I gonna do now?- Just pass the tape along.
10,6,119,"00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,582",He's not right for the part.
10,6,120,"00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,179","If I suggest him,my bosses will think I'm an idiot."
10,6,121,"00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,864",And that's somethingthey should learn on their own.
10,6,122,"00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,986",Just tell Joeythat you watched the tape...
10,6,123,"00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,141","...and you liked it,but your bosses didn't."
10,6,124,"00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,744","Then you're the good guy,and they're the bad guy."
10,6,125,"00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,101","That's good. I liked it, they didn't."
10,6,126,"00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,978","Joey, for God's sake, go to work."

10,6,128,"00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,465",I've always thought of himas someone I'd invite...
10,6,129,"00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,019",...to my fantasy dinner party.
10,6,130,"00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,346",Do you think there's any chancehe'll bring Christie Brinkley or C-3PO?
10,6,131,"00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,504","Sorry, it looks like it's just him."
10,6,132,"00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,589",Charlie.

10,6,138,"00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,908",It's an honor to meet you.I can't tell you how long...
10,6,139,"00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,860","...I've been an admirer of your work.I mean, that Nobel Prize."
10,6,140,"00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,463","I mean, I have to tell you that you'reone of the reasons I got into the field."
10,6,141,"00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,428","Well, likewise."
10,6,142,"00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,468",Not likewise. I'd never heardof you until this morning.
10,6,143,"00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,143",But it's nice to be nice.

10,6,145,"00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,426",I can't believe that you chosethis restaurant.
10,6,146,"00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,469","- Do you remember the night?- Oh, my God. I completely forgot."
10,6,147,"00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:58,744","Oh, my God, I can't believethey let us back in this place."
10,6,148,"00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:07,700",You weren't there.
10,6,149,"00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,308","No, but, you know,it's just a funny image."
10,6,150,"00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,783","You know, the two of youin this restaurant with the..."
10,6,151,"00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,305",Why don't you tell Benji about yourproposal while I go to the ladies' room.
10,6,152,"00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,622",So tell me about it.
10,6,153,"00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,068","Okay. Well, I would like to do a digin the Painted Desert."

10,6,159,"00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,184","- Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?- Listen, I'm sorry."
10,6,160,"00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,780","I just haven't seen her for so long,all these feelings are rushing back."
10,6,161,"00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:59,220",I'm starting to realizehow much I've missed her.
10,6,162,"00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,665",And I'm gonna need youto break up with her.

10,6,201,"00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:41,308",...on the Linnaean taxonomic system.How do you propose to correct this?
10,6,202,"00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,542",I believe that the answers liein the osteological evidence.
10,6,203,"00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:46,462",- I plan to begin there.- Interesting.
10,6,204,"00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,582",I guess.
10,6,205,"00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,219","Dr. Biely, your proposal includes somefieldwork. Where might that take place?"
10,6,206,"00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,950",Primarily in the Pierre Shale regionof South Dakota.
10,6,207,"00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,388","Certainly. Very well.And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?"
10,6,208,"00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,262",What? l...
10,6,209,"00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,260",Care to venture a guess?
10,6,210,"00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:18,549",- May 12?- That's not even kind of close.
10,6,211,"00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,780","Dr. Li, how many graduate studentswill you need?"
10,6,212,"00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:23,867",- Half a dozen.- I see. And Dr. Biely?
10,6,213,"00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,260","Three for excavation,and two for analysis."
10,6,214,"00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,105","Certainly. Dr. Geller,which 1965 Shirelles hit..."
10,6,215,"00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,342",...was later covered bya popular British Invasion band?
10,6,216,"00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,259",What? I need six graduate students.
10,6,217,"00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:43,145","No, I'm sorry.We were looking for ""Baby It's You."""

10,6,219,"00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,306",What? Wait just a minute.
10,6,220,"00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,542",None of my questions have anythingto do with paleontology.
10,6,221,"00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:54,099","You're right, I apologize.Scratch the last question."
10,6,222,"00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,340","Spell ""Boscodictiasaur."""

10,6,224,"00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,180","Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it."
10,6,225,"00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:10,186","- Okay. B-O...- No, it starts with a silent M."
10,6,226,"00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,460","Oh, come on!"
10,6,227,"00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,425",I can't believe Joey.I hate being called a liar.
10,6,228,"00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,949",But you are a liar.
10,6,229,"00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,107",What did I just say?
10,6,230,"00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,704",- Are you still here?- Yes.
10,6,231,"00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,148","And I'm not just hurt, I'm insulted.When I tell somebody I did something..."
10,6,232,"00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:38,303","Okay, hold on, let me just stop youright there, okay? First, you lied. Right?"
10,6,233,"00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,938","Then you lied about lying, okay?"
10,6,234,"00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,829","Then you lied about lyingabout lying, okay?"
10,6,235,"00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,223",So before you lie about lyingabout lying about lying about lying...
10,6,236,"00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,907",Stop lying.
10,6,237,"00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,624",Why are you so sureI didn't watch this tape?
10,6,238,"00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,781",You wanna know why?You wanna know why?
10,6,239,"00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,141","Well, this is going well."
10,6,240,"00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,102",Here's how I know.
10,6,241,"00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,940","If you had seen what was on this tape,believe me, you'd have some comments."
10,6,242,"00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,783","All right, remember,I got paid a lot of money for this..."
10,6,243,"00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,106",...and it only aired in Japan.
10,6,244,"00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,508",<i>Ichiban.</i>

10,6,253,"00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,583",- I haven't really settled on a spot yet.- How about right above the TV?
10,6,254,"00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,028","That way, it will be the first thingthat you see when you walk in the door."
10,6,255,"00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,506","Yeah, yeah, and you can get ridof that French poster."
10,6,256,"00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,541",- I like that poster.- Really?
10,6,257,"00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,060",It doesn't have anythingcoming out of it.
10,6,258,"00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,424",Or maybe there's someplacefor her in your bedroom?
10,6,259,"00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,225",- There's nothing above your bed.- Are you still here?
10,6,260,"00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:43,341","Oh, hi. Hello."
10,6,261,"00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,583",Have you come to ask me some morepaleontology-related questions?

10,6,265,"00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,341",No. Stop!
10,6,266,"00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:06,828","Anyway, I decidedto offer you the grant."
10,6,267,"00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,782",- Really?- There is just one small stipulation.
10,6,268,"00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,939","- I have to break up with Charlie?- Hey, you got one right."
10,6,269,"00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,622",- You're crazy.- Crazy or romantic?

10,6,274,"00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:47,106",I got her from Monica. She sold itto me for a very reasonable price.
10,6,275,"00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,746","- Joey, we're not keeping this.- But it's an original Buffay."
10,6,276,"00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,429","All right, fine. You can keep it."
10,6,277,"00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,820",As long as you don't mindthat she's haunted.
10,6,278,"00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,463","Hey, what? What?"
10,6,279,"00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,182","Well, legend has it, Joey, that shecomes alive when you're asleep."
10,6,280,"00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,308",She climbs out of the frame...
10,6,281,"00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,583",...and then drags her half-a-bodyacross the floor...
10,6,282,"00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,502",...just looking for legs to steal.
10,6,283,"00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:20,145",And then with her one good hand...
10,6,284,"00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:24,144",...she slowly reaches up...
10,6,285,"00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,426",...and turns your doorknob.
10,6,286,"00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,225",Get that legless witch out of here!
10,6,287,"00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,348","- Hey, I sold that to Joey.- Yeah, well, I told him it's haunted."
10,6,288,"00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,343",- Two can play at this game.- Too late. You can't give it back.
10,6,289,"00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,626","- Oh, yes, I can.- No, you can't, she's yours."

10,6,300,"00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,308","That's not the point, Chandler.The point is that you lied."
10,6,301,"00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,907",I know. You're right. What's itgonna take for you to forgive me?
10,6,302,"00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:30,145","Oh, my God."
10,6,303,"00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,186",Excellent.

10,6,311,"00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:08,547",Because your ex-boyfriendis still in love with you.

10,7,2,"00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,634","Hey, you guys.Hey, what are you doing?"
10,7,3,"00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,190",- Figuring out our wedding plans.- Funny. We were doing the same thing.
10,7,4,"00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,475","It's really crazy.The hall, the dress, the food."
10,7,5,"00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,315","- I had no idea how expensive this was.- Yeah, it is really pricey."
10,7,6,"00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,870","- I freaked when I heard the numbers.- So, what did you two do about it?"
10,7,7,"00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,838",It was simple. I came up withsome cost-cutting solutions...
10,7,8,"00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,709",...wrote out a listand Monica told me to go to hell.
10,7,9,"00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,359",There's no way around it. Just acceptthat this is gonna cost a lot of money.
10,7,10,"00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,830","I heard that weddings are, like,a $40 billion-a-year industry."
10,7,11,"00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,993","Yeah. And I'm responsiblefor just, like, half of that."
10,7,12,"00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,750","But really, it does seem likethis money could be put to better use."
10,7,13,"00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,989",Are you serious?
10,7,14,"00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,516",Yeah. How would you feel if we gaveall the wedding money to charity...
10,7,15,"00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,716",...and we just got marriedat City Hall?
10,7,16,"00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,031",I think it would make mewanna marry you even more.
10,7,17,"00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,875","I gotta say, you guys,that's an incredible gesture."
10,7,18,"00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,679",Maybe you do thatnext time you get married.
10,7,19,"00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,039","No, no, no. The next time'sgonna be Hawaii at sunset."
10,7,20,"00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,839",But maybe the time after that.
10,7,21,"00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,550",The One With the Home Study
10,7,22,"00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,828",- Hey. What's going on?- Hey.
10,7,23,"00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,470","Our adoption social worker is coming,so we're cleaning the apartment."
10,7,24,"00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,278","""We""?"
10,7,25,"00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,635",You know you don't want me to help.You can't have it both ways.
10,7,26,"00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,758",Is this the person who decideswhether or not you get a baby?
10,7,27,"00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,151",- She's coming to see where we live.- And it has to go perfectly.
10,7,28,"00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:14,199","If she doesn't like us, she can keepus off every adoption list in the state."
10,7,29,"00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,756","Hey, maybe I should stop by.She could be a soap opera fan."
10,7,30,"00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,959",It's very impressive whenthe little people know a celebrity.
10,7,31,"00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,479","""Little people""?"
10,7,32,"00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,392","""Celebrity."""
10,7,33,"00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,392",So I think I'm just about done here.
10,7,34,"00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,156","Unless you have any bad stuff hiddensomewhere, like porn or cigarettes?"
10,7,35,"00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,992",What?
10,7,36,"00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,679",- No.- Chandler.
10,7,37,"00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,749","I don't, and I'm offendedby the insinuation."
10,7,38,"00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,434",So there's not a magazineunder the couch...
10,7,39,"00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,478",...or cigarettes taped to the backof the toilet tank...
10,7,40,"00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,074",...or a filthy video in the VCR?
10,7,41,"00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,516",I'll admit the cigarettes and magazine.But that tape is not mine.
10,7,42,"00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,593",- It isn't mine.- I guess we'll never know whose it is.
10,7,43,"00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,308",May I help you?
10,7,44,"00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,631",We're here to make a rathersizable donation to the children.
10,7,45,"00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,314","Any contribution, large or small,is appreciated."
10,7,46,"00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,438",I think you're gonna appreciatethe crap out of this one.
10,7,47,"00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,910","- Well, this is very generous.- And we don't want any recognition."
10,7,48,"00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,718",This is completely anonymous.
10,7,49,"00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,348",Completely anonymous.From two kind strangers.

10,7,52,"00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,273",- Not necessary.- Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.
10,7,53,"00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,553","And X is spelled ""Mike Hannigan."""
10,7,54,"00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,033","Well, on behalf of the children,thank you both very much."
10,7,55,"00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,318",- I'm glad we did this. It feels so good.- It does. It feels really good.
10,7,56,"00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,948","Oh, look. And we getthese free T-shirts."
10,7,57,"00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,237","Actually, that's the shirtI wore to the gym."
10,7,58,"00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,113",It's moist.
10,7,59,"00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,720","- Hi. Emma will be up in a minute.- Oh, good."
10,7,60,"00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,112","Hey, Ross, listen. I heard aboutyou and Charlie. I'm really sorry."
10,7,61,"00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,319",That's okay. I'm sure there are tons ofother beautiful paleontologists out there.
10,7,62,"00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,123",- Absolutely.- There was one. She's it.
10,7,63,"00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,362",All the rest look likethey should live under a bridge.
10,7,64,"00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,329","So, what are you gonna do today?"
10,7,65,"00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,879",I was thinking of taking Emmato the playground.
10,7,66,"00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,445","Oh, my God. What?"
10,7,67,"00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,366","Like I said, I was thinking of takingEmma to the Museum of Knives and Fire."
10,7,68,"00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,402","Okay, look, Ross. I do not wantEmma going to the playground."
10,7,69,"00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,519",Because...?
10,7,70,"00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,285","All right, if you must know,I had a traumatic..."
10,7,71,"00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,920",...swing incident when I was little.
10,7,72,"00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,647",- Seriously?- Yes. I was 4 years old.
10,7,73,"00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,562",And I was on the swing...
10,7,74,"00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,405",...and then all of a sudden my hairgot tangled in the chain.
10,7,75,"00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,886","And to get me out, my mom hadto cut a big chunk of my hair."
10,7,76,"00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,088",And it was uneven for weeks.
10,7,77,"00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,642",And you made it through that?
10,7,78,"00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:23,760",I wonder who's gonna play youin the movie.
10,7,79,"00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,359","Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.I do not want Emma going there."
10,7,80,"00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,044",And I was thinking Claire Danes.
10,7,81,"00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,399","Look, I'm sorry to hearabout your tragedy."
10,7,82,"00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:38,165","But the swings are perfectly safe.And besides, Emma loves them."
10,7,83,"00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,120","- You should come, and you'll see.- Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour."
10,7,84,"00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:45,520",And there's that momentwhen you're at the top...
10,7,85,"00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,365",...when you just don't knowif you're gonna return back to Earth.
10,7,86,"00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,723",Space is filled with orbiting children.
10,7,87,"00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,681","Look, please, just come on."
10,7,88,"00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:02,399","When you see the look on Emma's face,I swear, you won't regret it."
10,7,89,"00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,363",- All right.- Good.
10,7,90,"00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,160",You don't wanna be a mom who passesher irrational fears to her children.
10,7,91,"00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,683","""Irrational,"" huh?"
10,7,92,"00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,479",I'll remember that next time you freakout about a spider in your apartment.
10,7,93,"00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,689",That's the same. I'm sure there are 30different species of poisonous swings.
10,7,94,"00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,846","Oh, my God.The adoption lady is early."
10,7,95,"00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,207",Okay. Okay. Here we go.Here we go.
10,7,96,"00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,564",Stand up straight.
10,7,97,"00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,527",Big smile.
10,7,98,"00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,689",Hello. Is this the Creepy residence?
10,7,99,"00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,126",We're waiting for the adoption lady.But I'm glad you're here.
10,7,100,"00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,758",I was cleaning this morningand I found this.
10,7,101,"00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:47,808","I don't knowif you wanna use it, but..."
10,7,102,"00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,962","Oh, this is so sweet of you."
10,7,103,"00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,759",But I won't be needing a veil.I actually won't be wearing a dress at all.
10,7,104,"00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,728","I told you, I am not comingto a naked wedding!"
10,7,105,"00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,085",No. We're not having a big reception.
10,7,106,"00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,004",We took the wedding moneyand donated it to a children's charity.
10,7,107,"00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,728",That's crazy!
10,7,108,"00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,809",I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving upmy one wedding day like that.
10,7,109,"00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,167","Well, we're different.I don't care about having a huge party."
10,7,110,"00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,480","This is really nice for you, but..."
10,7,111,"00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,120","Oh, please. I put this onand I just look like..."
10,7,112,"00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,360","Well, radiant."
10,7,113,"00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:29,078","All right, but who cares? I don't needa pretty veil and a fancy dress."
10,7,114,"00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,320",That's right.You're making a commitment.
10,7,115,"00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,641","You know, that's the samewhether you do it at the Plaza or..."
10,7,116,"00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,687",- Where you gonna do it?- City Hall.
10,7,117,"00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:41,248","Oh, that sounds nice."
10,7,118,"00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:45,483",I was just there for jury duty.They've really spruced that place up.
10,7,119,"00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:50,081",Okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.I've made my decision.
10,7,120,"00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,889",What I really wantis a great big wedding.
10,7,121,"00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,408","- But you gave all the money to charity.- Well, I'll just ask for it back."
10,7,122,"00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,919",- I don't think you can do that.- Why not?
10,7,123,"00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,163",This is her wedding day. That's waymore important than some stupid kids.
10,7,124,"00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,646","That's sweet, honey, but savesomething for the adoption lady."
10,7,125,"00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,689","- All right, okay. Be careful.- Okay."
10,7,126,"00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,081",Careful. Watch her hair.Watch her hair!
10,7,127,"00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,801","- Rach, she's got, like, three hairs.- I know. I know."
10,7,128,"00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,919","But they're just so beautiful.Oh, my God, I just pulled one out."
10,7,129,"00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:36,480",I promise you she's safe.Watch how much she loves this.
10,7,130,"00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:40,165","- Okay. Okay.- Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go."
10,7,131,"00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,281","Okay, careful. Okay."
10,7,132,"00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,922",She's smiling.
10,7,133,"00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,445","Look at that, she does like it."
10,7,134,"00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,929","See, I told you."
10,7,135,"00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,759","Oh, my God. Look at her,she's a little daredevil."
10,7,136,"00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,009","- Oh, God. Let me push. Can I push?- Oh, absolutely."
10,7,137,"00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:10,526","Oh, God. Okay, get the camera.It's in the diaper bag."
10,7,138,"00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,043",Okay.
10,7,139,"00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,680",See? Scared of the swings.I bet you feel pretty silly.
10,7,140,"00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,645",- We're asking for the money back?- It's for our wedding day.
10,7,141,"00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,803","Now, is this guy gay or straight?Because one of us has to start flirting."
10,7,142,"00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,169",You here to make anotherdonation the same day?
10,7,143,"00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,366",I don't think that's everhappened before.
10,7,144,"00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:36,122",Gay. Go.
10,7,145,"00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:41,729","Oh, my God, I love your shirt."
10,7,146,"00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,487","The donation we made earlier?Well, we want it back."
10,7,147,"00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,759",Excuse me?
10,7,148,"00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,240","Okay, that money was for a big weddingwe thought we didn't want."
10,7,149,"00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,684",But it turns out we do.
10,7,150,"00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,286",So you're asking us to refundyour donation to the children?
10,7,151,"00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,129",Yeah.
10,7,152,"00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,600",This feels really good.
10,7,153,"00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,478",I'm sorry. I am. But this wedding'sjust really important to me.
10,7,154,"00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,165","Hey, it's none of my business.Besides, this is probably a good thing."
10,7,155,"00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,767","We've really been spoiling the children,what with all the food and warm clothing."
10,7,156,"00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:22,328",That's not fair.A person's wedding is important.
10,7,157,"00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,048",And especially to me.
10,7,158,"00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:27,839",I didn't have a graduation party.And I didn't go to prom.
10,7,159,"00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:31,605",And I spent my sweet 16being chased around a tire yard...
10,7,160,"00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,285","...by an escaped mental patient who,in his own words, wanted to:"
10,7,161,"00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,042","""Kill me, or whatever."""
10,7,162,"00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,403",So I deserve a real celebration.
10,7,163,"00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,768",And I'm not gonna let some sweatylittle man make me feel badly about it.
10,7,164,"00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,247",She could've been talking abouteither one of us.
10,7,165,"00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,408","Hi, I'm Laura.I'm here for your adoption interview."
10,7,166,"00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,038","Hi, I'm Monica.And this is Chandler."
10,7,167,"00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,326",- Please come in.- Thank you.
10,7,168,"00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,402",- Would you like something to drink?- Water would be fine.
10,7,169,"00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,640",We're so glad that you're here.
10,7,170,"00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:14,324",We're excited aboutgetting this process started.
10,7,171,"00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,368",Because we love kids.Love them to death.
10,7,172,"00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,806","Well, not actually to death.That's just a figure of speech."
10,7,173,"00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,120",We love kids the appropriate amount...
10,7,174,"00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,885",...as allowed by law.
10,7,175,"00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,840",- Your place is just lovely.- Thank you.
10,7,176,"00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,889","Yes, this building does havea wholesome, family feel to it."
10,7,177,"00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,282",I feel like I've been here before. Anyother couples in the building adopting?
10,7,178,"00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,648",Is that that couple on the first floor?We should get a baby before them.
10,7,179,"00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,607",That guy tried to sell me drugs.
10,7,180,"00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:50,640","But other than that,wholesome, wholesome building."
10,7,181,"00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:56,166",- What?- I realized why I remember this place.
10,7,182,"00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,400","- Really? What is it?- Oh, it's nothing."
10,7,183,"00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,688",I went on a date with a guy who livedin this building. It didn't end very well.
10,7,184,"00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,683","That wouldn't, by any chance,be Joey Tribbiani?"
10,7,185,"00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,688",- Yes!- Of course it was.
10,7,186,"00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,642","We had a great night. In the morning,he promised he'd call and he didn't."
10,7,187,"00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,243",Rat bastard!
10,7,188,"00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:19,724","- So you're not friends with him?- Oh, God, no."
10,7,189,"00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,960","- No, no, no.- No. Nope."
10,7,190,"00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,445","Well, I'm sorry I brought it up."
10,7,191,"00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,647",So are either one of you planningon staying at home?
10,7,192,"00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,406",Hello?Anybody in there order a celebrity?
10,7,193,"00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,839",What was that?
10,7,194,"00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,480",That's just some crazy guywho roams the halls here.
10,7,195,"00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,481","He's great with kids, though."
10,7,196,"00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,439","- Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay?- Son of a bitch!"
10,7,197,"00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,770","Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word."
10,7,198,"00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,649","Ross, see, I told you!Those swings are evil!"
10,7,199,"00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,565",That's the last time Emma is getting onone of those things for her entire life.
10,7,200,"00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:20,120","No, no, no. Okay, it wasn'tthe swing's fault. It was my fault."
10,7,201,"00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,202",And kind of that kid's fault.
10,7,202,"00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:26,243",Who is still laughing. Nice.
10,7,203,"00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,886",Come on. Can we just get out of herebefore somebody else gets hurt?
10,7,204,"00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,122",No. Wait. I have an idea.I want you to get on the swing...
10,7,205,"00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,521",...and you'll see that there'snothing to be afraid of.
10,7,206,"00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,530",I know what this is all about.
10,7,207,"00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:45,201",You've always been jealous of my hair.
10,7,208,"00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:49,563","I just think you're an adult, okay?And you should get over your silly fears."
10,7,209,"00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,800","- All right, fine. I'll do it.- Good."
10,7,210,"00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,928",- lf you hold a spider.- Where?! Where?!
10,7,211,"00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,919",If you hold a spider.
10,7,212,"00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,682",I know.
10,7,213,"00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:09,004","Guys, is everything okay?It's me, Joey."
10,7,214,"00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,448",Adoption!
10,7,215,"00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,369",What's going on?
10,7,216,"00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,004","Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy..."
10,7,217,"00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,480","...Bert, roaming the halls."
10,7,218,"00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:25,767","- Guys?- Keep on roaming, Bert!"
10,7,219,"00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,683",We don't want any crazy today!
10,7,220,"00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:32,919",- What's going on?- We'll talk later! Everything's fine!
10,7,221,"00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,084",Everything doesn't sound fine.
10,7,222,"00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,485",Is he all right out there by himself?
10,7,223,"00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,767","Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker.His older brother..."
10,7,224,"00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,039",...Ernie.
10,7,225,"00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:49,000",- Bert and Ernie?- You can't make this stuff up.
10,7,226,"00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,088",You never told me about that guyand your sweet 16.
10,7,227,"00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,684","- I'm sorry about that.- Oh, it ended okay."
10,7,228,"00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,000",One of my friends shot him.
10,7,229,"00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,039",At least you'll get a proper wedding.You really deserve that.
10,7,230,"00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:08,089","Yeah, I really do.You know, I had nothing growing up."
10,7,231,"00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,690",Just like the kidsI took the money from.
10,7,232,"00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,446","No. No, no. I see where this is going.Don't make me go back there."
10,7,233,"00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,363","Look, I can't have a weddingwith this money now. It's tainted."
10,7,234,"00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:24,882","Fine, we'll give the money back."
10,7,235,"00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,405",If that guy at the charitygives us a hard time...
10,7,236,"00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,721",...my friend hasn't shot anyonein a really long time.
10,7,237,"00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,886",I must say this seems like a lovelyenvironment to raise a child in.
10,7,238,"00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,689",You are welcome to lookunder any of the furniture...
10,7,239,"00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,320","...because, believe me, you won't findany porn or cigarettes under there."
10,7,240,"00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:47,647","Before we look around, let me make sureI have everything I need up to here."
10,7,241,"00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,650",Why don't I show you the baby's room.
10,7,242,"00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,286",- What are you doing?- You wouldn't let me in.
10,7,243,"00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,680","- I thought you were in trouble.- Well, we're not."
10,7,244,"00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,000","But you called me ""Bert."""
10,7,245,"00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,560",That's our code word for danger.
10,7,246,"00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:14,319",- We don't have a code word.- We don't?
10,7,247,"00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,082",We really should.
10,7,248,"00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,243","From now on, ""Bert""will be our code word for danger."
10,7,249,"00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,844",So that was the baby's room.
10,7,250,"00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,682",- What room should we see next?- Any room that isn't behind this couch.
10,7,251,"00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,165","Some people don't get him,but I think he's really funny."
10,7,252,"00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,404",I did not care for that.
10,7,253,"00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,205",You have to leave.
10,7,254,"00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:48,089",You slept with our social workerand never called her back.
10,7,255,"00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,241","She is still pissed,so she can't see you."
10,7,256,"00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:52,162","Okay, okay."
10,7,257,"00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:57,643",- What?- I forgot my bat.
10,7,258,"00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,167","Oh, my God."
10,7,259,"00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,323","And for the last time,we do not want to be friends with you!"
10,7,260,"00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,369",And we don't wanna buy your bat!
10,7,261,"00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:14,362",What are you doing here?
10,7,262,"00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,169",Bert. Bert. Bert. Bert.
10,7,263,"00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,960",- Are you friends with him?- I can explain.
10,7,264,"00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,163",Joey?
10,7,265,"00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,721",All right. Okay.
10,7,266,"00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,568",You have got some nervecoming back here.
10,7,267,"00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,884",- I can't believe you never called me.- Excuse me?
10,7,268,"00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:43,959","You probably don't even remembermy name. It's Joey, by the way."
10,7,269,"00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:48,328","And don't bother telling me yours,because I totally remember it, lady."
10,7,270,"00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:52,761",I waited weeks for you to call me.
10,7,271,"00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,966",I gave you my number.You never called me.
10,7,272,"00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:57,166",Don't try to turn this around on me.
10,7,273,"00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:01,164",I am not some kind of social work...
10,7,274,"00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,809",...that you can just...
10,7,275,"00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:04,369",...do.
10,7,276,"00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:11,488",- I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.- Really? Think about it. Come on.
10,7,277,"00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,006","You're a beautiful woman.Smart, funny."
10,7,278,"00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,525",We had a really good time.
10,7,279,"00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,444","If I had your number,why wouldn't I call you?"
10,7,280,"00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,125",I don't know.
10,7,281,"00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,361","Well, maybe I'm wrong. I'm sorry."
10,7,282,"00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,160","Hey, too late for apologies. Okay?You broke my heart."
10,7,283,"00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,720",You know how many womenI had to sleep with to get over you?
10,7,284,"00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,681","- Joey, wait...- No!"
10,7,285,"00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,728",I waited a long time!I can't wait anymore.
10,7,286,"00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,843",I'm sorry that you had to see that.I'm so embarrassed.
10,7,287,"00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:53,082","- Oh, that's really okay.- Yeah. We totally understand."
10,7,288,"00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,799","- Dating is hard.- Boy, you people are nice."
10,7,289,"00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:00,168",And I've got to say...
10,7,290,"00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:03,959",...I think you're going to makeexcellent parents.
10,7,291,"00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,649",Laura!
10,7,292,"00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,208",We're back.
10,7,293,"00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:20,120",Are you here to take more money?
10,7,294,"00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,884",Because I think what you'relooking for is an ATM.
10,7,295,"00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,640","No, no, we're hereto give the money back."
10,7,296,"00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:29,519",Yeah. Because you know what?It's all about the children.
10,7,297,"00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,244",Although it's also about the wedding.
10,7,298,"00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:36,165","All right, here. No. Oh, God."
10,7,299,"00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,005","If I haven't said so already,sir, congratulations."
10,7,300,"00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,166","Okay, look, enough, all right?"
10,7,301,"00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,207",I'm stepping inand putting my foot down.
10,7,302,"00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,885","As your future husband,I'm gonna make this decision for us."
10,7,303,"00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,205",What do you think we should do?
10,7,304,"00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,041",- It's not your decision anymore.- What?
10,7,305,"00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,327","On behalf of the children of New York,I reject your money."
10,7,306,"00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,928",- But we're giving you this.- And I'm giving it back to you.
10,7,307,"00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,888",Come on. Consider it a contribution.
10,7,308,"00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:08,524","Well, this is very generous."
10,7,309,"00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,206",Take the check. Have a great weddingand a wonderful life together.
10,7,310,"00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:16,282","Sounds good to me. We can save up,come back in a few years..."

10,8,133,"00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,999",- Yeah!- These seats are great.
10,8,134,"00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,232","I know, I know.When I was here for ""Holidays on Ice""..."
10,8,135,"00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,198","...I was sitting so far away,Michelle Kwan couldn't read my banner."
10,8,136,"00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,757","We'd better get going. If we don'tleave now, we're gonna be late."
10,8,137,"00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,191",But it's a tie game. So we're a little late.The girls will be there.
10,8,138,"00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,555",Let's just stay for one more goal.
10,8,139,"00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,199",- I don't know.- One more fight.
10,8,140,"00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,197",- Okay.- Okay.
10,8,141,"00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,796",Where is everybody?They're 45 minutes late.
10,8,142,"00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,909",I can't believe they're not here.I slave and I slave for what?
10,8,143,"00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,356",They've ruined Cranberry Day.
10,8,144,"00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,390",- How late are we?- Forty-five minutes.
10,8,145,"00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,915",- Here.- Okay.
10,8,146,"00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,756","Rachel and Phoebe are already there,so they probably started without us."
10,8,147,"00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,037","We could just slip in, andno one needs to know where we were."
10,8,148,"00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,993","- You may want to lose the foam finger.- Oh, no, no, no."
10,8,149,"00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,754",You just want to put it on your hand.
10,8,150,"00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,471","- You're not at Thanksgiving?- No, we're late."
10,8,151,"00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,790",- What are you doing here?- We're late too.
10,8,152,"00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,520",We figured we could be latebecause you'd be on time.
10,8,153,"00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,678","Don't point that thing at me, Tribbiani."
10,8,154,"00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,116","- Nobody's here? Monica's gonna kill us.- Yeah, where were you?"
10,8,155,"00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,515","- Well...- Yeah, what's with the trophy?"
10,8,156,"00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,116","Well, we were at a spelling bee."
10,8,157,"00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,992",And I won.
10,8,158,"00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,514",You won an adultThanksgiving Day spelling bee?
10,8,159,"00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,078",Yes. Y-E-S. Yes.
10,8,160,"00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,473","Let me see this. ""Grand SupremeLittle Darling, New York Division""?"
10,8,161,"00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,989",That's me.
10,8,162,"00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,436",You entered Emma in a beauty pageant?
10,8,163,"00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,434",And it looks like she put makeup on her.
10,8,164,"00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,588",Wait a second. Where have I seenthat cowgirl outfit before?
10,8,165,"00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,036",I can't believe this. She's our daughter.
10,8,166,"00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,755",That you would treat her likesome kind of show dog is inexcusable.
10,8,167,"00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,794",- She won a thousand dollars.- So this is an annual thing?
10,8,168,"00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,078",That's Alicia May Emory's outfit!
10,8,169,"00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,352","Guys, there are people in therewho are not getting any happier."
10,8,170,"00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,030",- What are we gonna do?- I gotta put Emma down for a nap.
10,8,171,"00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,357","And, Rach, while you're in there,throw something on Alicia May."
10,8,172,"00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,833","- All right, what are we gonna say?- We'll say that we were mugged."
10,8,173,"00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,468",You can't get mad at someonewho's been mugged.
10,8,174,"00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,710",Good. But you don't looklike you were mugged.
10,8,175,"00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,155",No. Here.
10,8,176,"00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,959",Hey!
10,8,177,"00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,190",Do you hear something?
10,8,178,"00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,075",- They're out there.- Let me see.
10,8,179,"00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,073","I can't believe this. They're an hour late,and they're just standing there talking."
10,8,180,"00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,870",Everything's so distorted.It looks like Joey has a giant hand.
10,8,181,"00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:38,232","That says ""Rangers"" on it.They went to the game."
10,8,182,"00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,917","Oh, they are in for a world of pain."
10,8,183,"00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,713",- Ross' shirt is torn.- They're late and they're sloppy.
10,8,184,"00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,114","All right, Emma's napping.What happened to your shirt?"
10,8,185,"00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,949","I got mugged, and they stole my pocket."
10,8,186,"00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,913",We're just tryingto figure out an excuse.
10,8,187,"00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,158",How about this?
10,8,188,"00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,518","We could say that Monica told us 5:00,not 4:00. That way we're right on time."
10,8,189,"00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:12,789",Or we could plant PCP in theapartment and call the cops on her.
10,8,190,"00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,797",That would be a good way to get ridof all the PCP we have lying around.
10,8,191,"00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,871",We'll just say that she said it was 5:00.
10,8,192,"00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,635","We'll just act casual.We're not late, we're right on time."
10,8,193,"00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,313","""We know you're out there."""
10,8,194,"00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,235",Who do you think it's from?
10,8,195,"00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,954","Oh, God, this is bad. This is so bad."
10,8,196,"00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,475","Well, let's just go in thereand face them."
10,8,197,"00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,629",I'm not going in first. I bet that vein onMonica's forehead is popping like crazy.
10,8,198,"00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,469",I hate that thing.It's like a bolt of lightning.
10,8,199,"00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,514","Why don't we play rock, paper, scissors,and whoever loses, goes in first."
10,8,200,"00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,154","- All right, I'm in.- Ready."
10,8,201,"00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,279",I win.
10,8,202,"00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,989",- What is that?- That's fire. It beats everything.
10,8,203,"00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,112","Oh, really? Does it beat water balloon?"
10,8,204,"00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,312","Well-played, Phoebe Buffay.Well-played."
10,8,205,"00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,675","All right,let's all go in at the same time."
10,8,206,"00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,115",- Okay.- Okay.
10,8,207,"00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,310","- It's locked.- What? Oh, sure, now they lock it."
10,8,208,"00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,391","When they're having sex on the couch,it's like:"
10,8,209,"00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,757","""Come on in,my butt is surprisingly hairy!"""
10,8,210,"00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,228","All right, come on. All right, you guys,we're so sorry we're late."
10,8,211,"00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,834",Please let us in so we can havedinner together.
10,8,212,"00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,391","No, everything's cold. The turkey'sdried out and the stuffing's all soggy."
10,8,213,"00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,393","Yeah, and there's a bowlof cranberry sauce that's..."
10,8,214,"00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,278",What happens to cranberry sauce?
10,8,215,"00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,477","- Nothing, it's fine.- Oh, thank God."
10,8,216,"00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,036","Come on, you guys, we're sorry.Our subway broke down."
10,8,217,"00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,749",That's a lie! You went to the game.I can see Joey's hand.
10,8,218,"00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,916","For the love of God, take it off!"
10,8,219,"00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,879","Guys, it doesn't matterwhy we're late. We're all here now."
10,8,220,"00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,077",Please let us in so we can havesome of your delicious turkey.
10,8,221,"00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,918",I had a dream onceabout a fax machine that did that.
10,8,222,"00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,396",That's all the turkey you're gonna get.
10,8,223,"00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,354",- How are we gonna decide who gets this?- Water balloon!
10,8,224,"00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,280",What are we gonna do? I'm starving.
10,8,225,"00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,596","I just remembered,we do have something to eat."
10,8,226,"00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,274",Monica put somethingin our oven this morning.
10,8,227,"00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,635","You touch that,and you will be sorry!"
10,8,228,"00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,038","Guys, I'd listen to her.The vein is bigger than I've ever seen it!"
10,8,229,"00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,750","Oh, my God, it's Brussels sprouts!"
10,8,230,"00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,235",That's worse than no food.
10,8,231,"00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,797",All you got wasMonica's stinky Brussels sprouts.
10,8,232,"00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,115",Stinky?
10,8,233,"00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,517",Please let me stay on this sideof the door.
10,8,234,"00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,076","Oh, I know!I still have my old key."
10,8,235,"00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,356",We can just unlock the door.
10,8,236,"00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,398",I don't know if that's a good idea.They don't wanna be with us.
10,8,237,"00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,198",I don't wanna be with them either...
10,8,238,"00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,796","...but it's Thanksgiving, and we shouldnot want to be together together."
10,8,239,"00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,679","If I could just get in there,make a face-to-face apology..."
10,8,240,"00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,400","...Iook them in the eye,I could get them to forgive us."
10,8,241,"00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,199",- I don't know.- I'm telling you...
10,8,242,"00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,558",...I can do it.
10,8,243,"00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,950","Yeah, he can do it."
10,8,244,"00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,790",It all looks so beautiful.
10,8,245,"00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,589","- The turkey, the stuffing.- The cranberries."
10,8,246,"00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,837",Enough! A monkey could've made them.
10,8,247,"00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,951","Hey, listen, guys,we feel really terrible."
10,8,248,"00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,153",He's doing that weird eye-contact thing.
10,8,249,"00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,709",Don't look at him. Don't look at him.
10,8,250,"00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,311","Come on, you guys. We wantyou to know we're very, very sorry."
10,8,251,"00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,471","Right, guys?"
10,8,252,"00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,156","- I feel terrible.- Oh, so sorry."
10,8,253,"00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,794",But let's not ruin this day.You've worked so hard.
10,8,254,"00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,077","Let's move past this and try to havea nice meal all together, huh?"
10,8,255,"00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,272",The floating headsdo make a good point.
10,8,256,"00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,957","Yeah, they do seem to feel pretty bad."
10,8,257,"00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,594",- So bad.- So bad.
10,8,258,"00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,871",Okay.
10,8,259,"00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,477","Okay, you two go get the dessert,and I'll let you in."
10,8,260,"00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,230",Dessert?
10,8,261,"00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,752","Yeah, I asked you and Phoebe to pick upthe pies. You did remember, right?"
10,8,262,"00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,873","Pies. Oh, we thought you said ""prize."""
10,8,263,"00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,235",Here.
10,8,264,"00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,912","- ""Grand Supreme Little Darling""?- Congratulations!"
10,8,265,"00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,990","Oh, my God, you forgot the pies?Well, I cannot believe this."
10,8,266,"00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,589","You forced me to make dinner,you're an hour late..."
10,8,267,"00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,638",...and you forget the one little thingthat I asked you to do.
10,8,268,"00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,718","Really, girls, not cool."
10,8,269,"00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,310","Well, you man-heads aren't any better.You lied about going to the game."
10,8,270,"00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,710","You knew it'd make you late,and you went anyway."
10,8,271,"00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,678","Hey, I'm getting a little tired of this.We said we're sorry."
10,8,272,"00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,276","It's Thanksgiving, for Pete's sakes!A day of forgiveness."
10,8,273,"00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,399",- It's a day to be thankful.- Don't make me come up there!
10,8,274,"00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,999",It's too late for apologies.
10,8,275,"00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,958","Fine, let's just go.I don't need your stupid dinner."
10,8,276,"00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,913",That would be a lot more convincingif you weren't drooling.
10,8,277,"00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,472","- Oh, is that what that is?- Sorry."
10,8,278,"00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,188","Come on, you guys,let's just do our own Thanksgiving."
10,8,279,"00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,511","- Yeah, I'll cook.- Yeah, let's go out."

10,8,282,"00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,550","- I'm stuck.- Joey, that is not gonna work."
10,8,283,"00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,756","No, seriously."

10,9,106,"00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:25,168",That's why you won'tgo out with her again?
10,9,107,"00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:26,925",So she took some fries. Big deal.
10,9,108,"00:06:27,132 --> 00:06:29,327","Hey, look, it's not about a few fries."
10,9,109,"00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:31,290",It's about what the fries represent.
10,9,110,"00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,769",- What?- All food!
10,9,111,"00:06:34,372 --> 00:06:36,045","Well, I'm sorry."
10,9,112,"00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:39,329",I can't believe I set you upwith such a monster!
10,9,113,"00:06:39,492 --> 00:06:41,528","Hey, look, I take a girl out..."
10,9,114,"00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:44,810","...she can order whatever she wants.The more the better, all right?"
10,9,115,"00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:48,851",Just don't order a garden saladand then eat my food!
10,9,116,"00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:51,449",That's a good way to lose some fingers.
10,9,117,"00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,007",- Thank God you're here. Listen to this.- What?
10,9,118,"00:06:56,213 --> 00:06:59,762","Joey and my friend are out last night,having dinner, and she reaches over..."
10,9,119,"00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:02,685","...and takes a few of his fries...- Oh, no!"
10,9,120,"00:07:02,894 --> 00:07:04,884",What?
10,9,121,"00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:08,120",You know about the plate thing?
10,9,122,"00:07:08,334 --> 00:07:10,721","Oh, yeah, yeah. No,Joey doesn't share food."
10,9,123,"00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:13,531","I mean, just last weekwe were having breakfast..."
10,9,124,"00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:15,603",...and he had a couple grapeson his plate.
10,9,125,"00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:18,007","- You wouldn't let her have a grape?- No, not me."
10,9,126,"00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:19,447",Emma.
10,9,127,"00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,771",Joey doesn't share food!
10,9,128,"00:07:29,012 --> 00:07:32,245","Well, I still think that is a stupid reasonnot to call someone again."
10,9,129,"00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,603","You are calling her, okay?"
10,9,130,"00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:38,202","And if you need to, then justget an extra plate of fries for the table."
10,9,131,"00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:44,365",I like that.
10,9,132,"00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:46,807",A sharing buffer. Yeah.
10,9,133,"00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:50,283","Yeah, I'll order some extra fries.Maybe a plate of onion rings."
10,9,134,"00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:52,086",Yeah. Yeah.
10,9,135,"00:07:52,293 --> 00:07:54,524",And a shrimp cocktail.
10,9,136,"00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:56,846",And some Buffalo wings.
10,9,137,"00:07:57,012 --> 00:07:59,925","Maybe...Maybe an individual pizza, huh?"
10,9,138,"00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:02,483",And some mozzarella sticks.
10,9,139,"00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:05,370",What were we talking about?
10,9,140,"00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,968","Wow, this place is awesome."
10,9,141,"00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:14,608",We should just go.I'm not gonna find anything here.
10,9,142,"00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,125",This stuff is ridiculous.
10,9,143,"00:08:16,334 --> 00:08:18,894","Oh, this place is great!"
10,9,144,"00:08:20,653 --> 00:08:23,769","Rach, come on, I'm not gonna wearany of this. Nothing silver."
10,9,145,"00:08:23,973 --> 00:08:26,884","- Why?- Okay, nothing with hair."
10,9,146,"00:08:27,093 --> 00:08:29,687",And nothing with padlocks on it!
10,9,147,"00:08:29,853 --> 00:08:32,687","Ross, look. Look, I know that someof this stuff is out there."
10,9,148,"00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:35,447","But I mean, come on, look at this.Look at this sweater."
10,9,149,"00:08:35,614 --> 00:08:37,284","I mean, this is just beautiful."
10,9,150,"00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:39,568","Wow, this is really soft."
10,9,151,"00:08:40,452 --> 00:08:42,172",Three hundred and fifty dollars?
10,9,152,"00:08:42,374 --> 00:08:46,490","Down from 700.You're saving, like, 200 bucks."
10,9,153,"00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:52,167",Both logic and math are takinga serious hit today.
10,9,154,"00:08:52,972 --> 00:08:55,770","Hey, check this out. It's totally you."
10,9,155,"00:08:55,932 --> 00:08:57,206",- Wow.- Yeah.
10,9,156,"00:09:01,254 --> 00:09:03,528","Wow. Actually, this looks pretty good."
10,9,157,"00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:05,013",Yeah.
10,9,158,"00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,049","""Boys will be boys""?"
10,9,159,"00:09:11,173 --> 00:09:13,288",- What? They will be!- All right.
10,9,160,"00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,446","- That's it, I'm getting out of here.- No, Ross, wait, come on."
10,9,161,"00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:20,533","There's other stuff here. There's somenice shirts, these nice pants."
10,9,162,"00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,769","Actually, these might lookpretty good on me."
10,9,163,"00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:25,653","Yes, they will. You know what youshould do? Go take a walk."
10,9,164,"00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:29,361","All right? I know your size, and I'llpick out some really good stuff for you."
10,9,165,"00:09:29,572 --> 00:09:30,893",- Really?- Yes.
10,9,166,"00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:32,485",I know what looks sexy on guys.
10,9,167,"00:09:32,692 --> 00:09:35,650","Just wear what I suggest,and she is gonna go nuts for you."
10,9,168,"00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:37,173",So you're saying...
10,9,169,"00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:41,326","...if I wear these pants,I might be getting into hers?"
10,9,170,"00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:44,568",Why do men keep talking to me like this?
10,9,171,"00:09:47,374 --> 00:09:50,571",So the fact that I'm a doctorand my wife's a reverend...
10,9,172,"00:09:50,732 --> 00:09:52,131",...that's important to you?
10,9,173,"00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:54,169",Yeah. I read some great applications...
10,9,174,"00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:57,245","...but I thought, ""Who betterthan a minister to raise a child?"""
10,9,175,"00:09:57,452 --> 00:09:58,932",Amen.
10,9,176,"00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:04,043","Plus, I thought the baby would bein good hands with a doctor."
10,9,177,"00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:05,731",Good hands.
10,9,178,"00:10:05,894 --> 00:10:07,884",Healing hands.
10,9,179,"00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:12,211","Reverend, can I ask? Does the Biblesay anything about adoption?"
10,9,180,"00:10:12,413 --> 00:10:14,289","It says, ""Do it."""
10,9,181,"00:10:15,932 --> 00:10:20,562","""And behold, she did adoptunto them a baby."
10,9,182,"00:10:22,134 --> 00:10:24,567","And it was good."""
10,9,183,"00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:29,004","- Wow.- Yeah, wow."
10,9,184,"00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:32,121",I was wondering...You both have such serious jobs.
10,9,185,"00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:35,250",Would you have time to take careof a baby and your flock?
10,9,186,"00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,568","Oh, no, my flock? My flock is good."
10,9,187,"00:10:37,732 --> 00:10:40,884",Yeah. My flock pretty muchtakes care of themselves by this point.
10,9,188,"00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:43,168","Good flock. Flock, flock, flock."
10,9,189,"00:10:45,293 --> 00:10:47,807","But being a doctor,that must take up a lot of time."
10,9,190,"00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,653",Not for me it doesn't.
10,9,191,"00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:52,803",So how's everything going in here?
10,9,192,"00:10:52,972 --> 00:10:55,486",We're great. I thinkI may have asked all my questions.
10,9,193,"00:10:55,653 --> 00:10:57,451",Good. Do you have questions for Erica?
10,9,194,"00:10:57,614 --> 00:11:01,207","Yeah, actually.So you read a file that you liked..."
10,9,195,"00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:04,808",...and then you gave the agencythe serial number and they contacted us?
10,9,196,"00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:07,207",Yes. Our system ensurestotal anonymity.
10,9,197,"00:11:07,374 --> 00:11:10,284",- We're very proud of it.- You should be.
10,9,198,"00:11:10,894 --> 00:11:13,692",You're really on top of stuff.
10,9,199,"00:11:13,852 --> 00:11:17,369","Well then, if there's nothing else,then the two of us should talk."
10,9,200,"00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:19,013",I actually...
10,9,201,"00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:21,369",- I don't think we have to.- We don't?
10,9,202,"00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:24,649","Yeah, when I read about you two,I was pretty sure I wanted you..."
10,9,203,"00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:27,326",...but I just thought we should meetface to face.
10,9,204,"00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,602",I've made my decision.
10,9,205,"00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:31,566",I choose them.
10,9,206,"00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:33,965","God, this is great."
10,9,207,"00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:35,929",This is so great. Did you hear that?
10,9,208,"00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:37,605","Yeah, I did."
10,9,209,"00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:39,245",Hey.
10,9,210,"00:11:39,452 --> 00:11:42,808",Thank you. Thank you so much.
10,9,211,"00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,164",You are so going to heaven!
10,9,212,"00:11:52,092 --> 00:11:55,370",- We got some really great stuff.- Yeah.
10,9,213,"00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:57,923","Yeah, but I'm not sure about someof the bras I got."
10,9,214,"00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,562",Really? Do you want to trysome of them on for me?
10,9,215,"00:12:00,774 --> 00:12:02,048",Okay.
10,9,216,"00:12:02,212 --> 00:12:04,807","Wait, are we in Joey's imagination?"
10,9,217,"00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:10,163","Oh, no. I took one of Ross' bagsby mistake."
10,9,218,"00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:12,129",And one of mine is missing.
10,9,219,"00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:14,601",Ross probably has it.You'll get it from him later.
10,9,220,"00:12:20,212 --> 00:12:23,284","So, what do you think?"
10,9,221,"00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:28,524",I think we're not wearingthe same shirt anymore.
10,9,222,"00:12:29,494 --> 00:12:31,644","Yeah. Yeah, Rachel picked it out for me."
10,9,223,"00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:34,533","She told me to trust her,and you know what? I'm glad I did."
10,9,224,"00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:37,206",I turned quite a few headson my way over here.
10,9,225,"00:12:39,374 --> 00:12:42,172","Dude, I really don't thinkyou should be wearing that."
10,9,226,"00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:44,167",I see.
10,9,227,"00:12:44,332 --> 00:12:48,405",Somebody's afraid of a little competitionwith the ladies?
10,9,228,"00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:51,845",Looks like someone is the ladies!
10,9,229,"00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:55,285",You're just jealousbecause you couldn't pull this off.
10,9,230,"00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:59,121","Yeah. Now if you'll excuse me,I have a date."
10,9,231,"00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:05,250",See? All eyes on me!
10,9,232,"00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:12,644",- We are not signing those papers.- Why not?
10,9,233,"00:13:12,972 --> 00:13:16,364",It's wrong. They made a mistake.They think we're somebody else.
10,9,234,"00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,961",God works in mysterious ways.
10,9,235,"00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:21,769",You have got to stop.
10,9,236,"00:13:22,293 --> 00:13:23,773",But she liked us.
10,9,237,"00:13:23,972 --> 00:13:26,645",She likes Doctor Chandlerand Reverend Monica.
10,9,238,"00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:30,443","If you think about it,I'm kind of like a reverend."
10,9,239,"00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:37,006","I mean, as a chef, I serve Godby feeding the hungry and poor."
10,9,240,"00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,530",Your veal chop is 34.95!
10,9,241,"00:13:41,812 --> 00:13:44,451","Come on, I just...I think we've been given an opportunity."
10,9,242,"00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:47,447",The mistake's already made.They're writing up the papers now.
10,9,243,"00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:49,451",But we're not the ones she chose.
10,9,244,"00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:51,605",How can you feel okay about this?
10,9,245,"00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:54,971",Because.
10,9,246,"00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,283",We may not be who she thinks we are...
10,9,247,"00:13:58,452 --> 00:14:01,091",...but no one will everlove that baby more than us.
10,9,248,"00:14:01,293 --> 00:14:02,773","- I know.- I mean, who knows..."
10,9,249,"00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:05,812",...how long it's gonna takefor someone else to give us a baby?
10,9,250,"00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:08,442",What if no one ever picks us?
10,9,251,"00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,206","Oh, honey..."
10,9,252,"00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:11,885",Please?
10,9,253,"00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:14,442",Please. We are so close.
10,9,254,"00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:18,528","Monica, I want a baby too."
10,9,255,"00:14:18,692 --> 00:14:20,889",But this woman is giving away her child.
10,9,256,"00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:23,807",She deserves to know who it's going to.
10,9,257,"00:14:30,774 --> 00:14:32,808",Okay. You're right.
10,9,258,"00:14:34,653 --> 00:14:36,961",So we'll tell the truth.
10,9,259,"00:14:37,134 --> 00:14:40,490","And who knows, you know?Maybe she'll like us for us."
10,9,260,"00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,809",Maybe she will.
10,9,261,"00:14:45,614 --> 00:14:47,443",Why couldn't I have been a reverend?
10,9,262,"00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:49,769",You're Jewish.
10,9,263,"00:14:51,134 --> 00:14:53,250",Technicality!
10,9,264,"00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,004",Garden salad for the lady.

10,9,331,"00:19:57,653 --> 00:19:59,485",- What?- That's impossible.
10,9,332,"00:19:59,694 --> 00:20:02,844",I could perform an operation on youand prove it if you'd like.
10,9,333,"00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:07,532",I have to check your file. Excuse me.

10,9,337,"00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,805",...is how much we would carefor this little baby.
10,9,338,"00:20:18,014 --> 00:20:19,890",So you lied to me before?
10,9,339,"00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:23,563","Well, we ""bore false witness."""
10,9,340,"00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:27,323",See? I could be a reverend.
10,9,341,"00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:29,726",I can't believe this.
10,9,342,"00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:32,368",But we were hoping thatsince we told you the truth...
10,9,343,"00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:35,525",...that you still might consider...- Giving you my baby?
10,9,344,"00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:37,729",You think I'd give you my childafter this?
10,9,345,"00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:40,448",You don't have to decide now.If you look at our file...
10,9,346,"00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:43,572",I don't want to look at your file.This is over.
10,9,347,"00:20:47,813 --> 00:20:49,486","Erica, wait."

10,9,349,"00:20:51,694 --> 00:20:53,764","Look, you have every reason to be upset."
10,9,350,"00:20:53,934 --> 00:20:55,286",We did lie.
10,9,351,"00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:59,372",But only because we've been waitingand trying to have a baby for so long.
10,9,352,"00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:02,843",And we don't know how long it's gonnabe before we get another chance.
10,9,353,"00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,090",Why don't you ask the reverendto pray on it?
10,9,354,"00:21:05,254 --> 00:21:08,006","Erica, please."
10,9,355,"00:21:08,214 --> 00:21:12,207",Just consider us.Ask them to see our file.

10,9,360,"00:21:23,694 --> 00:21:25,810",But it doesn't matter.What you did was wrong.
10,9,361,"00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:28,402",But you did like us.
10,9,362,"00:21:28,573 --> 00:21:30,485",And you should.
10,9,363,"00:21:30,974 --> 00:21:33,123",My wife's an incredible woman.

10,9,368,"00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:55,291",It kills me that I can't give her a baby.
10,9,369,"00:22:00,573 --> 00:22:02,849",I really want a kid.
10,9,370,"00:22:03,893 --> 00:22:07,442","And when that day finally comes,I'll learn how to be a good dad."
10,9,371,"00:22:08,014 --> 00:22:09,686",But my wife...
10,9,372,"00:22:10,173 --> 00:22:12,209",...she's already there.
10,9,373,"00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:14,445",She's a mother...

10,9,380,"00:23:16,613 --> 00:23:18,092",Because it's soft.
10,9,381,"00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:21,533","Hey, so how was your date?"
10,9,382,"00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,451",Not so good.

10,10,42,"00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,229",...so I was wondering if you wanted tocome to the movies with me and Rachel.
10,10,43,"00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,316","Oh, I have to work too. Yeah,I'm stuck here at the office all day."
10,10,44,"00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,755","Well, it's a shamethat you'll miss the movie..."
10,10,45,"00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,152","...because we were gonna see,you know, either <i>Liar Liar</i>..."
10,10,46,"00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,309",...or <i>Betrayal</i>or <i>An Affair to Remember</i>.
10,10,47,"00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,871",Those are all really old.
10,10,48,"00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,988","Okay, then maybe it'll be..."
10,10,49,"00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,832","<i>Dude, Where's My Car?</i>"

10,10,52,"00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,074",Jeez!
10,10,53,"00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,913","Okay, quick. We gotta find a caband follow them."
10,10,54,"00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,153","Yeah, okay. Let me just grab mynight-vision goggles and my stun gun."
10,10,55,"00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,471",I got them.

10,10,59,"00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,437","Well, at least the perfume's not mine.Be thankful for that."
10,10,60,"00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,558",So... What did you think of the house?
10,10,61,"00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,597",It's everything we've been looking for.
10,10,62,"00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,354",Isn't it? And what aboutthe amazing wanes coating...
10,10,63,"00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,159",...the crown moldingand the dormer windows in the attic?
10,10,64,"00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,550",And the wiggle woms and the zip zorps!
10,10,65,"00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,878",What were the things you said?
10,10,66,"00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,873",- Don't you love the huge yard?- The fireplace in the bedroom.
10,10,67,"00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,951",And Nancy said it's really underpriced...
10,10,68,"00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,908",...because the guy lost his joband has to move in with his parents!
10,10,69,"00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,799",This is bringing out a lovely color in you.
10,10,70,"00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,109",So do you think we should get it?
10,10,71,"00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,759",I don't know. What do you think?
10,10,72,"00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,319",- I think we should.- I do too.
10,10,73,"00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,948",This is huge. How bad do you wannasmoke right now?
10,10,74,"00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,038","I don't know what you mean,giant, talking cigarette."
10,10,75,"00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,470",Phoebe called as I was gettinginto Nancy's car.
10,10,76,"00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,517","If she asks you, I was at work all day."
10,10,77,"00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,432",Got you. When do we tell them?
10,10,78,"00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,115",We don't. Not until it's 100 percent.Why upset everybody over nothing?
10,10,79,"00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,554",Okay. Right.
10,10,80,"00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,555","- Oh, my God, that is gonna be so hard.- I know. Good luck with it."
10,10,81,"00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,155",I just can't see Chandler cheating.
10,10,82,"00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,710","I'm telling you guys, we followedthem out to a house in Westchester."
10,10,83,"00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,351","They went in for 45 minutes, and thenthey came out looking pretty happy."
10,10,84,"00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,553",Chandler?
10,10,85,"00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,199",Forty-five minutes?
10,10,86,"00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,878","Well, something's not right."
10,10,87,"00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,157",I can't believe he'd do this to Monica.
10,10,88,"00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,436","I know, and with the baby coming?"
10,10,89,"00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,750",- So should we tell her?- I don't know.
10,10,90,"00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,674","If one of us saw Mike with anotherwoman, would you want us to tell you?"
10,10,91,"00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,035",Why? Who'd you see him with?
10,10,92,"00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,476",- No one. I'm just saying if we did...- Tell me what you know!
10,10,93,"00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,753",No one! Nothing! Mike's a great guy!It was hypothetical!
10,10,94,"00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,034",All right. He is a good guy.
10,10,95,"00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,191",You're right. He wouldn't cheat.
10,10,96,"00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,830","If I did see him with someone,there's no way l..."
10,10,97,"00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,991",Who did you see him with?
10,10,98,"00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,113","Oh, look at her. So happy."
10,10,99,"00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,711",If only there were a smaller oneto clean this one.
10,10,100,"00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,237","Hey, is Chandler here?"
10,10,101,"00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,550","No, he's picking up dinner.Why? What's up?"
10,10,102,"00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,075","Look, whatever happens,we're here for you, and we love you."
10,10,103,"00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,389",- All right.- Chandler might be having an affair.
10,10,104,"00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,194",- What?- Phoebe and I saw Chandler...
10,10,105,"00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,477",...with a blond woman todayoutside on the street.
10,10,106,"00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,996",And then we followed themto a house in Westchester.
10,10,107,"00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,516",They went in together. I'm so sorry.
10,10,108,"00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,269","Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that's awful."
10,10,109,"00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,675",What did you think of the house?
10,10,110,"00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,113",What?
10,10,111,"00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,629","Monica, you understandwhat we're saying, right?"
10,10,112,"00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:02,430","Yeah. Sure. I mean,I'm devastated, obviously."
10,10,113,"00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,113",Did you think the neighborhoodwas homey?
10,10,114,"00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,712",- Hey.- You son of a bitch.
10,10,115,"00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,232","Is it me, or have the greetingsgone downhill around here?"
10,10,116,"00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,749",Phoebe and Rachelsaw you with Nancy today.
10,10,117,"00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,592",They think you're having an affair.
10,10,118,"00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,478",- Who's Nancy?- What's going on?
10,10,119,"00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,632",Okay...
10,10,120,"00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,233","All right, you better sit down."
10,10,121,"00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,994",- This is... This is pretty big.- Yeah.
10,10,122,"00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,679",I'm not having an affair.
10,10,123,"00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,833",Nancy is our realtor.
10,10,124,"00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,549",I knew he couldn't bewith a woman for 45 minutes!
10,10,125,"00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,597",Why do you have a realtor?
10,10,126,"00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,839",She's been showingus houses outside of the city.
10,10,127,"00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,633",- What?- Are you serious?
10,10,128,"00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,314",When we found outthat we were gonna get this baby...
10,10,129,"00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,631",...Chandler and I decidedwe didn't want to raise a kid in the city.
10,10,130,"00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,631",So you're... So you're gonna move?
10,10,131,"00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,672","Oh, my God."
10,10,132,"00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,919",Shouldn't we all vote on stuff like this?
10,10,133,"00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,430",What is wrong with raising a kidin the city?
10,10,134,"00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,955",I'm doing it. Ross is doing it.
10,10,135,"00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,475",Sarah Jessica Parker is doing it!
10,10,136,"00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,790","And that's great for you guys,but we want a lawn and a swing set."
10,10,137,"00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,076",A street where our kidscan ride their bikes...
10,10,138,"00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,231",...and maybe an ice-cream truckcan go by.
10,10,139,"00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,960",So you want to buy a house in the '50s.
10,10,140,"00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,556",Have you thought aboutwhat you're giving up?
10,10,141,"00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,790",You can't move out of the city.What if...?
10,10,142,"00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,951",What if you want Chinese foodat 5 a.m.?
10,10,143,"00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,839",Or a fake Rolex that breaksas soon as it rains?
10,10,144,"00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,231",Or an Asian hookersent right to your door?
10,10,145,"00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,676","You know what? If you want to lookfor a house, that's okay."
10,10,146,"00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,752","No! No, it's not! Don't listen to him.I'm gonna thump you."
10,10,147,"00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,716","It's okay, because they haveto get it out of their system."
10,10,148,"00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,676",Okay? But you're gonna realizethis is the only place you want to be.
10,10,149,"00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,432",Actually...
10,10,150,"00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,318",...we already found a house we love.
10,10,151,"00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,712","- What?- About an hour ago, we made an offer."
10,10,152,"00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,394","Bet you wish I washaving an affair now, huh?"
10,10,153,"00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,949",- You put an offer on a house?- It's so sweet.
10,10,154,"00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,351",It really is. It has this big yardthat leads down to this stream.
10,10,155,"00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,397",And then there's these old maple trees.
10,10,156,"00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,120","Oh, again with the nature.What are you, beavers?"
10,10,157,"00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,314","Look, I know this is really hard,and we're really sorry."
10,10,158,"00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,597",Is this because I come over herewithout knocking and eat your food?
10,10,159,"00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,876",Because I can stop doing that.
10,10,160,"00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,315","I really, really think I can."
10,10,161,"00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,789","You know that's not the reason, Joe."
10,10,162,"00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,715","I think if you saw it, you'd understand."
10,10,163,"00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,075","You guys were there.It's beautiful, isn't it?"
10,10,164,"00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,150","- Yeah, it is.- What the hell are you doing?"
10,10,165,"00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,995","Well, it is, all right? When we wereout there today, all I kept thinking was:"
10,10,166,"00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,435","""I can't believe Chandler'sscrewing this woman..."
10,10,167,"00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,830","...but, man, this would bea nice place to live!"""
10,10,168,"00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,071","Yeah, but so is this."
10,10,169,"00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,152","Yeah. I mean, if you move there,you have to leave here."
10,10,170,"00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,675","I mean, how can you leave this place?"
10,10,171,"00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,995","Come on, Daddy, listen!"
10,10,172,"00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,755","All my life, everyone'salways told me, ""You're a shoe!"""
10,10,173,"00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,354","""You're a shoe! You're a shoe.You're a shoe!"""
10,10,174,"00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,398","I stopped and said,""What if I don't want to be a shoe?"
10,10,175,"00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,516",What if I want to be a purse?
10,10,176,"00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,752","Or a hat?"""
10,10,177,"00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,788","I don't want you to buy me a hat,l..."
10,10,178,"00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,076","It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
10,10,179,"00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,711",You can see where he'd have trouble.
10,10,180,"00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,231","Well, maybe I'll just stayhere with Monica."
10,10,181,"00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,509",I guess we've establishedshe's staying with Monica.
10,10,182,"00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,231","Your money's mine, Greene."
10,10,183,"00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,038","Your fly's open, Geller."

10,10,191,"00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,395","Instead of watching football,you could help."
10,10,192,"00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,391",We know.
10,10,193,"00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,512","Rachel, you want to putthe marshmallows in concentric circles."

10,10,295,"00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,832",This isn't exactly the kind ofThanksgiving you planned...
10,10,296,"00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,549",...but for me this hasbeen really great.
10,10,297,"00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,030",I think because it didn'tinvolve divorce...
10,10,298,"00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,428",...or projectile vomiting.
10,10,299,"00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,718",If you had gone to Vail...

10,10,303,"00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,951",So I guess what I'm tryingto say is...
10,10,304,"00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,717",...that I'm very thankful that allof your Thanksgivings sucked.
10,10,305,"00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,671",- That's so sweet!- Thank you.

10,10,315,"00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,072",...but it makes me feel better.
10,10,316,"00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,595","And now when I look over,who am I gonna see?"
10,10,317,"00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,115",The Gottliebs? The Yangs?

10,12,75,"00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,558","I'm not that fond of you either, buddy.I'm just trying to be nice for the kids."
10,12,76,"00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,191",You know what? We have no idea whatwe're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
10,12,77,"00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,158",I thought we'd be groomsmen.They would have asked us by now.
10,12,78,"00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,709",When did they ask youto be a bridesmaid?
10,12,79,"00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,839",- November.- I wanna say it's not looking good.
10,12,80,"00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,912","Hey, Pheebs?"
10,12,81,"00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,595",You haven't told these guyswhat they're doing in the wedding yet.
10,12,82,"00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,158","Well, they're not in the wedding."
10,12,83,"00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,918",What?
10,12,84,"00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,312",Well...
10,12,85,"00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,910",...this is really awkward.
10,12,86,"00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,675","Oh, and I can leave."
10,12,87,"00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,918","I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's gothis brother and his friends from school."
10,12,88,"00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,991","So, you know, you were..."
10,12,89,"00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,392","If it helps, you were next in line.You just missed the cut."
10,12,90,"00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,874","Oh, man."
10,12,91,"00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,157",This is like figure skating teamall over again.
10,12,92,"00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,869","I mean, synchronized swimming."
10,12,93,"00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,918","I mean...I mean, the balance beam."
10,12,94,"00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,354",- Help me.- Football.
10,12,95,"00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,078",Thank you.
10,12,96,"00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,916","Oh, Pheebs, spit that out.That has pork in it."
10,12,97,"00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,273",I thought the pot stickerswere supposed to be vegetarian?
10,12,98,"00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,273","Yeah, I changed them.I sent you a fax about it."
10,12,99,"00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,670",I don't have a fax machine.
10,12,100,"00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,348","Well, then there are gonna bea few surprises."
10,12,101,"00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,557",I can't believe we're gonna bethe only people not in the wedding.
10,12,102,"00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,156",- I know. I hate being left out of things.- And it's a wedding.
10,12,103,"00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,914",It'll be weird if I'm not in it.
10,12,104,"00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,839","- Hey, guys, how's it going?- Fine."
10,12,105,"00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,676","We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing.It's our rehearsal for tomorrow."
10,12,106,"00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,629","Look, about tomorrow,I've got a question for you."
10,12,107,"00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,872",I found out one of my groomsmenhad an emergency and can't make it.
10,12,108,"00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,634",- What happened?- Who cares? And...?
10,12,109,"00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,756",And I was wonderingif one of you guys...
10,12,110,"00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,070",- I'll do it!- Me!
10,12,111,"00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,274",You both wanna do it?There's only room for one.
10,12,112,"00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,000","Pick me. I look great in a tux,and I won't steal focus."
10,12,113,"00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,472","No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me.I mean... Watch."
10,12,114,"00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,709","You know, I really don't feelvery comfortable making this decision."
10,12,115,"00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,917","You know, Phoebe knows you better.I'm gonna let her choose."
10,12,116,"00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,873","Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then sayhello to Mike's next groomsman."
10,12,117,"00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,199","Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror..."
10,12,118,"00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,351",...as he is me.
10,12,119,"00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,876","- Please. You're going down.- You are going ""downer."""
10,12,120,"00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,917",They say that on thefigure skating team?
10,12,121,"00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,674",I wouldn't know. I didn't make it.
10,12,122,"00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,318","You know I'm filling infor Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?"
10,12,123,"00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,870","- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.- Oh, hey, my pleasure."
10,12,124,"00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,555","So, what are your intentionswith my Phoebe?"
10,12,125,"00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,955","- I intend to marry her.- Oh, a wiseacre."
10,12,126,"00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,799",I understand you plan to supportyour wife by playing the piano?
10,12,127,"00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,390",Isn't that kind of unstable?
10,12,128,"00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,359",- No more so than acting.- Strike two.
10,12,129,"00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,597",You're right.She probably will support me.
10,12,130,"00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,910","Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad."
10,12,131,"00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,071",Strike three.
10,12,132,"00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,477","You only get one more, Mike."
10,12,133,"00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,119",So? What did you decide?
10,12,134,"00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,709",I decided to pee.
10,12,135,"00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,233",You have to choose one of usto be in your wedding.
10,12,136,"00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,709","- One of the groomsmen fell out.- Oh, no, no."
10,12,137,"00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,316",I can't choose between you two.I love you both so much.
10,12,138,"00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,995",Just not enough to put usin the original wedding party.
10,12,139,"00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,789",But I don't wanna choose.It's...
10,12,140,"00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,797","- Okay, wait. Rach?- Yeah?"
10,12,141,"00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,236","Listen, I have a very specialbridesmaid task for you to do."
10,12,142,"00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,238",Goody! What is it?
10,12,143,"00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,709","Well, there's a spot openfor only one groomsman..."
10,12,144,"00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,395",...and you have to choose between Rossand Chandler. So good luck with that.
10,12,145,"00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,154","What? What, what, what?No, I don't wanna do that."
10,12,146,"00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,151",I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.
10,12,147,"00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,992",I'll do it!
10,12,148,"00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,191","Okay, it's 2100 hours."
10,12,149,"00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,113",- Time for your toast.- Do I have time to go to the bathroom?
10,12,150,"00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,398","You had a bathroom break at 2030.Pee on your own time, Mike."
10,12,151,"00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,238","In regards to the toasts, okay,you wanna keep them short."
10,12,152,"00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,278",Nothing kills a rehearsal dinnerlike long speeches. Okay.
10,12,153,"00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,670","You just get in, do your thing,and get out."
10,12,154,"00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,558",Is that what you say to Chandler?
10,12,155,"00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,839","It's 2101, and I am not amused."
10,12,156,"00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,673",Okay.
10,12,157,"00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,674",The bride and groomhave a few words they'd like to say.
10,12,158,"00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,510","Okay. Hello, everyone."
10,12,159,"00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,639",And thank you all for being here tonight.So tomorrow's the big event.
10,12,160,"00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,793","Some of you might not know, but Mikeand I didn't get off to the best start."
10,12,161,"00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,197",Yeah. My friend Joey and I...
10,12,162,"00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,558",...decided to fix each other upwith friends. So l...
10,12,163,"00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,195","Oh, okay. I..."
10,12,164,"00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,432","I thought about it, and I fixed him upwith my friend Mary Ellen..."
10,12,165,"00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,195","...who couldn't be here tonight,because... It's not..."
10,12,166,"00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,874","It's not important.Well, she's in rehab."
10,12,167,"00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,031",Anyway. So Joey said that he wasfixing me up with his friend Mike...
10,12,168,"00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,670","...only he didn't have a friend Mike,so he just brought my Mike."
10,12,169,"00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,035",And... And...
10,12,170,"00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,351","But despite, you know...It got good."
10,12,171,"00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,596","I wanna take a moment to mentionmy mother, who couldn't be here."
10,12,172,"00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,398","Oh, God."
10,12,173,"00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,716",And... And moment's over.
10,12,174,"00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,758","So okay... Oh, no, forget that."
10,12,175,"00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,911","I can forget that. Oh, this is funny."
10,12,176,"00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,470","Oh, but you need to know thatto get that."
10,12,177,"00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,200","So...Oh, well, okay."

10,12,180,"00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,149","This is my wedding, okay?I don't want this..."
10,12,181,"00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,709",Or this... Or this...
10,12,182,"00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,030",Okay? I just wanted a simple wedding...
10,12,183,"00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,351",...where my fianc can goto the bathroom any time he wants!
10,12,184,"00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,070",- You know what? You're done.- What?
10,12,185,"00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,992",You're fired!

10,12,190,"00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,875",We're gonna have hair and makeupin the bathroom.
10,12,191,"00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,430",I had to move a couple things in thefridge to make room for the corsages.
10,12,192,"00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,036",Man! I wouldn't have had breakfastif I knew there was gonna be corsages.
10,12,193,"00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,598",Hi.
10,12,194,"00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,635",About last night...

10,12,196,"00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,513","Well, even though the things you saidhurt me a little bit..."
10,12,197,"00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,673",My point is...
10,12,198,"00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,274","Well, I'm willing to take my job back."
10,12,199,"00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,590","Oh, well, that's okay."
10,12,200,"00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,638",I think you and I will do much betterif you're just here as a bridesmaid.
10,12,201,"00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,356",Is that so?
10,12,202,"00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,794",Okay.

10,12,205,"00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,992","I guess if you're taking over, then youshould probably return these messages."
10,12,206,"00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,276",This is a lot.
10,12,207,"00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,193",But I'm sure you can handle this.I have won awards...
10,12,208,"00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,397",...for my organizational skills.But I'm sure you'll do fine.
10,12,209,"00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,836",- You've won awards?- I printed them out on my computer.
10,12,210,"00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,119",- Hey.- Hi.
10,12,211,"00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,157",- Where's Rach?- She's in her room. Why?
10,12,212,"00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,794",I have to talk to herabout this groomsman situation.
10,12,213,"00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,475",I'm not gonna watch Chandler up therewhile I'm in the seats like some chump.
10,12,214,"00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,357","My God, you're breathtaking."
10,12,215,"00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,632",What do you want?
10,12,216,"00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,555","You haven't by any chancechosen a groomsman yet, have you?"
10,12,217,"00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,274","Ross, please don't make thisharder than it already is."
10,12,218,"00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,238",I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me.
10,12,219,"00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,390",- Chandler said it's important to him too.- Listen. Listen.
10,12,220,"00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,156",Whoever you pick is gonnawalk down the aisle with you.
10,12,221,"00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,756","Now, I promise I won't say a word.But if you pick Chandler..."
10,12,222,"00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,310",...he's gonna be whispering stupid jokesin your ear the whole time.
10,12,223,"00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,275","Oh, you are the lesser of two evils."
10,12,224,"00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,158",Yes!
10,12,225,"00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,674","Sven, I don't understand what you'resaying. What is wrong with the flowers?"

10,12,240,"00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,595","And instead, you disrespect me."
10,12,241,"00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,352",I cannot allow this.
10,12,242,"00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,516",Are you rehearsingfor some really bad Mafia movie?
10,12,243,"00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,718",More back talk.
10,12,244,"00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,714","And yes, I may be borrowing a few linesfrom my recent unsuccessful audition..."
10,12,245,"00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,395",...for <i>Family Honor 2:</i><i>This A-Time It's A-Personal.</i>

10,12,247,"00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,430",I want you to take this seriously!
10,12,248,"00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,637","Phoebe is very,very important to me, okay?"
10,12,249,"00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,155",I wanna make sureyou are gonna take care of her.
10,12,250,"00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,916","Joe, I love Phoebe."
10,12,251,"00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,196",She's the most important thingin my life.
10,12,252,"00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,272",I'd die before I letanything happen to her.
10,12,253,"00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,792",That's what I wanted to hear.
10,12,254,"00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,680","Because she's family, okay?"
10,12,255,"00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,592",And now you're gonna be family.
10,12,256,"00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,709",And there's nothing more importantin the whole world than family.
10,12,257,"00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,076",That must have been one lousy movie.
10,12,258,"00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,151",That was me!
10,12,259,"00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,469",- Hi.- Let's talk about this groomsman thing.
10,12,260,"00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,438","If you pick Ross, he'll walk youdown the aisle just fine."
10,12,261,"00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,431",But if you choose me...
10,12,262,"00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,875",...you'll be getting some comedy.
10,12,263,"00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,434",Even so...
10,12,264,"00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,396",...I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
10,12,265,"00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,915",Let me tell youwhy you need to pick me.
10,12,266,"00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,316","See, when I was a kid, you know,I was always left out of everything..."
10,12,267,"00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,392",...and it really made me feel insecure.
10,12,268,"00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,394",I was always picked last in gym...
10,12,269,"00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,314",...even behind that fat exchange studentwho didn't know the rules to baseball.
10,12,270,"00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,075","I mean, this guy would strike outand then run to third."
10,12,271,"00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,198","Anyway, if I'm the only oneleft out of this wedding..."
10,12,272,"00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,353",...I just know that all those feelingsare gonna come rushing back.
10,12,273,"00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,511","All right, fine, I pick you."
10,12,274,"00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,398",Yes!
10,12,275,"00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,316","Make ""groom"" for Chandler."
10,12,276,"00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,959","Oh, my."
10,12,277,"00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,832","No, we're gonna do it my way.Because your way is stupid."
10,12,278,"00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,515","All right, I got to go.I have another call, Reverend."
10,12,279,"00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,398",Hello?

10,12,286,"00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,676","Oh, my God, what's it doing here?"
10,12,287,"00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,799",I guess it got sent to the billing addressas opposed to the shipping address.
10,12,288,"00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,033","- What a pickle.- Oh, my God, everything's such a mess."
10,12,289,"00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,668",Why is this happening to me?

10,12,369,"00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,389",Ministers don't ride the subway for free.
10,12,370,"00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,757","I had to read the Bible pretty carefully,but, yeah, we do."

10,13,91,"00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:30,106","Rach, I think I'm gonna wait out here because..."
10,13,92,"00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:33,076","my throat is feeling a little scratchy,I don't wanna infect him."
10,13,93,"00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:35,088","Ross, please, don't be so scared of him."
10,13,94,"00:05:35,088 --> 00:05:37,770","I am not scared of him, I'm really sick."
10,13,95,"00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,591","He's still under sedation, so he's pretty much out."
10,13,96,"00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,794",I'm feeling better.
10,13,97,"00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:46,969","Oh, my god."
10,13,98,"00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:53,675","Oh, wow, that ear and nose hair trimmer I got himwas just money down the drain, huh?"
10,13,99,"00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:57,412","Miss Green, your father's doctor is on the phoneif you'd like to speak to him."
10,13,100,"00:05:57,412 --> 00:05:59,232","Oh, great. Uh, are you gonna be ok?"
10,13,101,"00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:02,394","He's unconscious, I think we'll be just fine."
10,13,102,"00:06:37,653 --> 00:06:39,952",Did the TV wake you?
10,13,103,"00:06:39,953 --> 00:06:47,522","No, when you put your feet up on my bed,you tucked on my cathode."
10,13,104,"00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:51,833",Ouchy.
10,13,105,"00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,654","What are you doing here, Galler?"
10,13,106,"00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:57,486","Well, I came with Rachelwho should be back any second."
10,13,107,"00:06:57,487 --> 00:06:59,019",So what's new?
10,13,108,"00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,894","Ooh, I had a little heart attack."
10,13,109,"00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:03,522","Great, is it painful?"
10,13,110,"00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:07,355",What? A heart attack is sitting here talking to you.
10,13,111,"00:07:08,217 --> 00:07:10,803",Let's see if we can get Rachel back in here.
10,13,112,"00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:14,540","So what's new with you, huh?Knocked up any more of my daughters laterly?"
10,13,113,"00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:17,032",Nope! Just the one. Rach!
10,13,114,"00:07:22,972 --> 00:07:25,079",Noo!
10,13,115,"00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,241","Ok, maybe if we just break it down."
10,13,116,"00:07:28,242 --> 00:07:32,745","Ok, let's just try one syllable at a time.Ok, so repeat after me."
10,13,117,"00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:38,111","Great, ok, faster."
10,13,118,"00:07:45,776 --> 00:07:47,788","Ok, it's too hard, I can't teach you!"
10,13,119,"00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:48,458",What are you doing?
10,13,120,"00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,661",I have to go before pull your head through a wall!
10,13,121,"00:07:50,662 --> 00:07:55,260","No, no! Don't go, I need you. My audition is tomorrow!"
10,13,122,"00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:17,584",Hey. I was gonna make some dinner but all I foundin your dad's frige was bacon and heavy cream.
10,13,123,"00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,747",I think we solve the mystery of heart attack.
10,13,124,"00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:21,896",Did you call your parents?
10,13,125,"00:08:21,897 --> 00:08:25,729","- Oh, yeah, Emma is doing great.- Oh, good."
10,13,126,"00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,645",Wow.
10,13,127,"00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:28,794",What?
10,13,128,"00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:32,435",Just can't believe I'm in Rachel Green's room.
10,13,129,"00:08:32,436 --> 00:08:34,927",What do you mean? You have been in my room before.
10,13,130,"00:08:34,927 --> 00:08:37,801","Yeah, sure, right."
10,13,131,"00:08:37,802 --> 00:08:39,814",Like I have ever been in Rachel Green's room.
10,13,132,"00:08:39,814 --> 00:08:43,550","Ok, I gotta tell you, it's really weirdwhen you use my whole name."
10,13,133,"00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:46,615",Sorry.
10,13,134,"00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:48,723",- Are you ok?- Yeah.
10,13,135,"00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:50,161","'Yeah' to a rough day, huh?"
10,13,136,"00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:53,418","Yeah, it's just so weird seeing him like that, you know?"
10,13,137,"00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:57,922","I mean, he's a doctor,you don't expect doctors to get sick."
10,13,138,"00:08:57,922 --> 00:09:00,029",But we do.
10,13,139,"00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:06,353","You know, he's gonna be ok, Rach."
10,13,140,"00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,773","Oh, I don't want him to wake up alone,I should go to the hospital."
10,13,141,"00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:14,976","What? No, no, wait. Hey hey, look."
10,13,142,"00:09:14,977 --> 00:09:18,713","They gave him a lot medication, ok,he wouldn't even know if you were there."
10,13,143,"00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:21,204","Look, we'll go and see himthe first thing in the morning, ok?"
10,13,144,"00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:23,311","- Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?- No, God. Hey."
10,13,145,"00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,707","Rach, you've been an amazing doughter, ok?"
10,13,146,"00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:27,623","Right now, you just need to get some rest."
10,13,147,"00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:30,115","Ok, maybe you're right."
10,13,148,"00:09:30,115 --> 00:09:33,276",Good night.
10,13,149,"00:09:33,277 --> 00:09:35,863","Wait, wait."
10,13,150,"00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:39,696",Would you stay here with me for a while?
10,13,151,"00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:41,516",Sure.
10,13,152,"00:09:42,954 --> 00:09:45,061",Thank you for coming with me today.
10,13,153,"00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:46,785","Oh, of course."
10,13,154,"00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:50,618",Rachel Green is very happy you're in her room.
10,13,155,"00:09:51,002 --> 00:09:54,738","Me, too. Come here."
10,13,156,"00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:58,091",I just don't want to be alone tonight.
10,13,157,"00:09:58,092 --> 00:10:02,882","Ok, well, I can, maybe grab a sleeping bag or..."
10,13,158,"00:10:17,254 --> 00:10:18,978","No, Rach!"
10,13,159,"00:10:19,937 --> 00:10:23,386","I'm sorry, I just don't think this is a good idea."
10,13,160,"00:10:23,386 --> 00:10:25,589","We won't know that until we do it, will we?"
10,13,161,"00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,560","No, uh look, uhm..."
10,13,162,"00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,775",You are upset about your fatherand you're feeling vulnerable.
10,13,163,"00:10:32,776 --> 00:10:37,758","And I just don't feel it will be rightif I'd like be, you know, taking advantage of you."
10,13,164,"00:10:37,758 --> 00:10:42,548","What taking advantage?I'm giving you the advantage, enjoy!"
10,13,165,"00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:45,901","Ok, I'm sure it would be great but..."
10,13,166,"00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:51,171","I think one of us has to be thinking clearly,so I'm gonna go."
10,13,167,"00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:03,722",I'll see you in the morning.
10,13,168,"00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:10,717","Haven't had sex in 4 months,I should get a medal for that!"
10,13,169,"00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,758","Thanks so much for taking me to all these places,I had a great time."
10,13,170,"00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:21,434","Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I want to apologizeabout Chandler, though."
10,13,171,"00:11:21,434 --> 00:11:23,250",I just did not see this coming.
10,13,172,"00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:26,787",NY is awesome!
10,13,173,"00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,368",What is with you?
10,13,174,"00:11:29,368 --> 00:11:32,617","You know, I've been to these beforebut I've never really seen them, you know?"
10,13,175,"00:11:32,618 --> 00:11:35,485","Yeah, you missed a lot when you were mooing."
10,13,176,"00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:38,448",Thanks so much for showing me around.
10,13,177,"00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,175","Oh, it was our pleasure.We're so much enjoying getting to know you."
10,13,178,"00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:45,330","Well, is there anything else you want to know?"
10,13,179,"00:11:45,713 --> 00:11:49,536","Oh, uh, ok."
10,13,180,"00:11:49,823 --> 00:11:52,212",Do you mind if I ask you some questionsabout the father?
10,13,181,"00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,314","Oh, sure, yeah."
10,13,182,"00:11:54,315 --> 00:11:59,380","Well, he was my high school boyfriend,captain of the football team, really cute."
10,13,183,"00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:01,674","And he got a scholarship, went off to college."
10,13,184,"00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:03,491",That's great.
10,13,185,"00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:07,505","Yeah, it's almost definitely him."
10,13,186,"00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,372",How is that now?
10,13,187,"00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:13,240","Well, there is a chance it's another guy."
10,13,188,"00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:19,167","I mean, I've only ever been with 2 guysbut they sorta overlapped."
10,13,189,"00:12:19,836 --> 00:12:22,607","So, what does the other guy do?Does he go to the college, too?"
10,13,190,"00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:25,188","No, he's in prison."
10,13,191,"00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,923","Uh, was he falsely accused of sth?"
10,13,192,"00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,842",No. He killed his father with a shovel.
10,13,193,"00:12:36,563 --> 00:12:38,856",But other than that he's a great guy.
10,13,194,"00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:42,680",I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.
10,13,195,"00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:53,767",- Are you awake?- Of course I'm awake.
10,13,196,"00:12:53,768 --> 00:12:57,591",As so from now on I'm always awake.
10,13,197,"00:12:58,452 --> 00:13:01,892","Alright, we don't know that it's him.I mean, it could be the football guy."
10,13,198,"00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:05,716","Honey, it's us. Of course it's the shovel killer."
10,13,199,"00:13:09,252 --> 00:13:11,163","Alright, alright, let's say it is him."
10,13,200,"00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:14,318",Would we not want baby? No.Would we treat him any differently?
10,13,201,"00:13:14,318 --> 00:13:17,472",I'll keep an eye on him.
10,13,202,"00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,678",- We have to find out which one the father is.- How?
10,13,203,"00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:24,641","I don't know, there're tests for these things, right?"
10,13,204,"00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,934","Yeah, but maybe we're just overreacting."
10,13,205,"00:13:26,935 --> 00:13:30,758",Easy for you to say. He's a father killer.
10,13,206,"00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,479",He probably loves his mommy.
10,13,207,"00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:36,302","He's probably got a tattoo says ""Mom""on the shovel wielding arm."
10,13,208,"00:13:41,082 --> 00:13:44,905","""We'll now count from 1 to 5: ....."""
10,13,209,"00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:57,904","- ""Good job!""- Thank you."
10,13,210,"00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,720","Hey, Joey."
10,13,211,"00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,359","Listen, I feel really badly about yesterdayand I thought it about a lot know I was too inpatient."
10,13,212,"00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,698",So let's try it again.
10,13,213,"00:14:06,698 --> 00:14:11,955","Oh no, that's ok. I don't need your help.I work it out on myself and I gotta say I'm pretty good."
10,13,214,"00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:13,866",Really? Can I hear some of them?
10,13,215,"00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:16,925","Sure, sure."
10,13,216,"00:14:16,925 --> 00:14:18,836",Ok.
10,13,217,"00:14:25,624 --> 00:14:27,344",See?
10,13,218,"00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,932","Alright, you're not, you're not..."
10,13,219,"00:14:31,932 --> 00:14:35,755","Again, you're not SPEAKING FRENCH!"
10,13,220,"00:14:36,998 --> 00:14:40,343","Oh, well I think I am, yeah.And I think I'm definitely gonna get the part."
10,13,221,"00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:42,350",How could you possibly think that?
10,13,222,"00:14:42,542 --> 00:14:46,174","For one thing, the guy on the tape saidI was doing a good job!"
10,13,223,"00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:52,196","Hi, Rach, can you grab me a cup of coffee?"
10,13,224,"00:14:54,012 --> 00:14:55,063",Sure.
10,13,225,"00:14:56,975 --> 00:15:00,320","You've been quiet all morning, is everything ok?"
10,13,226,"00:15:02,614 --> 00:15:05,768",- You sure you are alright.- Yep.
10,13,227,"00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:09,592","Ookay. Uhm, well I'm gonna go grab some breakfast."
10,13,228,"00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:12,937",- FYI...- There it is.
10,13,229,"00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:20,679","In the future, when a girl asks forsome ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it."
10,13,230,"00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:25,172","Wait, wait, you're mad at me about last night?"
10,13,231,"00:15:25,363 --> 00:15:27,083",I was just trying to do the right thing.
10,13,232,"00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:32,436","Really? Well it seems to me if you've done the right thing, I would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed,"
10,13,233,"00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:36,259",I would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied.
10,13,234,"00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,465","- Well...- Oh, stop that!"
10,13,235,"00:15:41,134 --> 00:15:42,663",I can't believe this. What do you...
10,13,236,"00:15:42,664 --> 00:15:44,002",I was just being a good guy.
10,13,237,"00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:46,487",I treated you with respect and understanding.
10,13,238,"00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,258","Ahh, that is so hot."
10,13,239,"00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:51,075","Hey, I was looking out for you."
10,13,240,"00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:56,809","Oh, really? Well Ross, you know what? I am a big girl,I don't need someone telling me what is best for me."
10,13,241,"00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,971","I gotta say I have not had sex a lot times before,this is the worst ever."
10,13,242,"00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:05,507","Oh really, really?Well, it wasn't very good for me, either."
10,13,243,"00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:07,610","Oh, ok, you know, hey hey! You know what?"
10,13,244,"00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:12,103","To avoid this little thing in the future,let's just say you and me, never having sex again."
10,13,245,"00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:12,772",What?
10,13,246,"00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:18,793","That's right, sex is off the table!I'm never having sex with you again."
10,13,247,"00:16:24,338 --> 00:16:27,205","Dr Green, are you feeling better?"
10,13,248,"00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,939","Hey, how was lunch?"
10,13,249,"00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,666",We had a good time.
10,13,250,"00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:35,162","BTW, I want to ask you sth."
10,13,251,"00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,986",It would really mean a lot to me.
10,13,252,"00:16:36,986 --> 00:16:43,705","If the baby is a boy, would youname him after my father Jiminy Billy Bob?"
10,13,253,"00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:48,696","Oh, really?"
10,13,254,"00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:52,536","Noo. You were right, that was fun."
10,13,255,"00:16:54,744 --> 00:16:58,583",I'm gonna go finish packing.
10,13,256,"00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,230","So, is she gonna take the test?"
10,13,257,"00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,822","No, she doesn't have to.I found out who the father is."
10,13,258,"00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:08,182","Oh, God, it's Shovelly Joe, isn't it?"
10,13,259,"00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:08,853","No, it's not."
10,13,260,"00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:10,005",How do you know?
10,13,261,"00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:13,077","Well, it turns out thatErica didn't pay much attention in sex ed class."
10,13,262,"00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:17,300",Because the thing she did with the prison guywould be pretty hard to make a baby that way.
10,13,263,"00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:22,100","Oh, God. What was it? The thingwe hardly ever do or the thing we never do?"
10,13,264,"00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:26,611",The thing we never do.
10,13,265,"00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:29,491",Shovelly Joe.
10,13,266,"00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:41,201","- Whenever you're ready, Joey.- Right."
10,13,267,"00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:49,743","I'm sorry, what's going on?"
10,13,268,"00:17:49,744 --> 00:17:52,623","Dude, come on. French it up."
10,13,269,"00:17:54,256 --> 00:17:56,175","Joey, do you speak French?"
10,13,270,"00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:06,157","You know what, I think this audition is over."
10,13,271,"00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:08,653","Uh, excuse me?"
10,13,272,"00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,493","Uh, I am Ugeon Phillogne."
10,13,273,"00:18:13,069 --> 00:18:22,859",I was passing by when I heard this man speakingthe regional dialect of my French town of Estelloude.
10,13,274,"00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,795",You really think this man is speaking French.
10,13,275,"00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,798","Good job, little buddy."
10,13,276,"00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:02,213",That was some really good French.
10,13,277,"00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:04,901",But I think we're gonna go with someone else for the part.
10,13,278,"00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:07,685","Oh, alright. But my French was good?"
10,13,279,"00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:10,084",It was great.
10,13,280,"00:19:10,085 --> 00:19:11,716",Merci.
10,13,281,"00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:22,659","- Emmas's down for the night.- Oh, good."
10,13,282,"00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:26,498","So, I guess I'm gonna takeoff."
10,13,283,"00:19:26,595 --> 00:19:28,994","Hey, listen, just before you go, I..."
10,13,284,"00:19:28,994 --> 00:19:31,393",Again I just wanna say 'thank you' for coming with me.
10,13,285,"00:19:31,394 --> 00:19:33,313","Oh, no problem."
10,13,286,"00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:38,113","And also, you know I...I was thinking about what you said,"
10,13,287,"00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:40,800","uh, you know, about the whole sex thing and..."
10,13,288,"00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:44,352",Probably not a great idea to go down that road again.
10,13,289,"00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,519",Thank you. I'm glad you agree.
10,13,290,"00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,127","It's shame though, I mean, when we did it,it was pretty good."
10,13,291,"00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:56,254","Yeah, yeah, that's true."
10,13,292,"00:19:56,351 --> 00:19:59,422","Hey, do you remember that one really great time?"
10,13,293,"00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:00,669","Oh, yeah."
10,13,294,"00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:04,509","- You know, it was your birthday...- It was Valentine's day..."

10,13,296,"00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:14,684","Well, I guess that's all the past now."
10,13,297,"00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,579",Uh-huh.
10,13,298,"00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:23,034",- Not even one more time.- Not even once.
10,13,299,"00:20:23,035 --> 00:20:27,162",- No matter how much we want it.- Even if we want it REALLY bad.
10,13,300,"00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:29,465",That's what WE decided.
10,13,301,"00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:33,305",Right.
10,13,302,"00:20:33,881 --> 00:20:35,800","- It's kinda hard, though.- Yeah."
10,13,303,"00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:40,504","You know? When two people have a connection,you know, that's..."
10,13,304,"00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:46,455",just seems like... such a waste.
10,13,305,"00:20:50,007 --> 00:20:52,598",I hate waste.
10,13,306,"00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:59,125",- Ross...- Yes.
10,13,307,"00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:01,909","Just so you know,"
10,13,308,"00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,613","with us, it's never off the table."
10,13,309,"00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,124","Dammit, it's never off the table."
10,13,310,"00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,724","Ok, can you really tap dance?"
10,13,311,"00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:29,685",No.
10,13,312,"00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:32,765",Off the resume.

10,15,57,"00:03:21,454 --> 00:03:24,813","We close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse us"
10,15,58,"00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:28,749",and we're easily confused. We're not very bright.
10,15,59,"00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,533",But what if it is better than ours?Should we at least look?

10,15,70,"00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,476",Joey's gonna be so upset.
10,15,71,"00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:11,275",I know. He always wanted to be the first black man to cross the Atlantic.
10,15,72,"00:04:12,237 --> 00:04:16,748","Well, we cannot tell Joey about this.He's already flipping out about everything that's changing."
10,15,73,"00:04:16,748 --> 00:04:18,379",This will push him over the edge.
10,15,74,"00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,819","Seriously, you don't think we should tell him?"
10,15,75,"00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:24,043","Well, not for a little while.Let's just give him a few days to get used to everything else."
10,15,76,"00:04:24,044 --> 00:04:25,579",What if he reads it in the paper?
10,15,77,"00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:30,379","Unless Snoopy says it to Charlie Brown, I think we're okay."
10,15,78,"00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,002",May I help you?
10,15,79,"00:04:37,003 --> 00:04:41,802","Yeah, I'm a friend of Rachel Green's.Uhm, actually we met at the Christmas party about two years ago."
10,15,80,"00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:46,698","Oh right, uhm, Don?Close. Ron."
10,15,81,"00:04:48,523 --> 00:04:50,922",Uh... What can I do for you?
10,15,82,"00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:55,531","Uhm, well...I'm here to see if you'll give Rachel her job back."
10,15,83,"00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:57,642","Ah, did she ask you to come here and do this?"
10,15,84,"00:04:57,643 --> 00:05:02,442","Oh, no.Then we'll see if she wants to come back.At first I have to get you to agree."
10,15,85,"00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:06,089","Wow, that is tempting."
10,15,86,"00:05:06,091 --> 00:05:08,970","Look, she loved her job here."
10,15,87,"00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:13,001",And let's face it you're not gonna find anyone who did it as well as she did it.Isn't that true?
10,15,88,"00:05:13,003 --> 00:05:17,130","She is good!Huh, I took a shot there."
10,15,89,"00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,105",But I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do...
10,15,90,"00:05:20,106 --> 00:05:24,233","Ah, it's not true, there is... nothing I want to do."
10,15,91,"00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:29,033",I see... Thanks very much.
10,15,92,"00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:34,313",Is this your son?
10,15,93,"00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:39,113","Yeah, his name is Ross."
10,15,94,"00:05:39,882 --> 00:05:41,609",What?
10,15,95,"00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:46,408","Oh, nothing, it's just, it's close to Ron."
10,15,96,"00:05:47,273 --> 00:05:50,440",Does he.. Does little Ross like dinosaurs by any chance?
10,15,97,"00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:54,184","Yeah, they're all he talks about, why?"
10,15,98,"00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:58,888",How would he like to come with me to the Museum of Natural History
10,15,99,"00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:02,344","after everyone else has leftjust the two of us,"
10,15,100,"00:06:02,345 --> 00:06:07,144",and he can touch anything he wants.
10,15,101,"00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:14,632",I just heard it as you must have heard it and that's not good.Let me start again.
10,15,102,"00:06:14,633 --> 00:06:18,280",I'm a paleontologist
10,15,103,"00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,079",you'll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones - fossils!
10,15,104,"00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:26,344",You can really arrange that?
10,15,105,"00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:30,375","You let Rachel come back, and it's done."
10,15,106,"00:06:30,376 --> 00:06:33,735","Well, I guess having Rachel back wouldn't be the worst thing in the world."
10,15,107,"00:06:33,736 --> 00:06:36,711",Yeah! Yes! Thank you! This is great.Thank you so much.
10,15,108,"00:06:36,712 --> 00:06:38,727","And I swear, your kid is going to have the time of his life."
10,15,109,"00:06:38,727 --> 00:06:43,238",That's great. I worry about little Ross.
10,15,110,"00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,039","He's always reading, he's collecting rocks and he's obsessed with dinosaurs.He'll be fine."
10,15,111,"00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:50,341",Hey Phoebe.
10,15,112,"00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,302",Hey. Everything ok?
10,15,113,"00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:52,934",I'm just mad at my agent.
10,15,114,"00:06:52,935 --> 00:06:54,854",Estelle? Why?
10,15,115,"00:06:54,856 --> 00:06:57,927",There's a part in a TV movie that I would be perfect for and I didn't even be put up for it!
10,15,116,"00:06:57,927 --> 00:07:02,726",She'd better have a good reason.
10,15,117,"00:07:03,207 --> 00:07:06,278",I'm guessing she does.
10,15,118,"00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,294","WellI'm wanna hear it, because she keeps doing this."
10,15,119,"00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:12,326","Well, no, no, wait, wait, wait.All right, I gotta go."
10,15,120,"00:07:12,327 --> 00:07:15,782","Just listen.Promise me, that you will wait a minute before you call her."
10,15,121,"00:07:15,782 --> 00:07:17,988",Ok. Why?
10,15,122,"00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,789",Because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason.
10,15,123,"00:07:27,398 --> 00:07:32,197",I love that saying!
10,15,124,"00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,701","Hello?Joey, it's Estelle."
10,15,125,"00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:44,677",I was just gonna call you! That's weird.
10,15,126,"00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:49,477","It's a little coincidental, but believable."
10,15,127,"00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:51,876","Listen, I'm sure you're wondering"
10,15,128,"00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:54,757",why I didn't get you an audition for that TV movie.
10,15,129,"00:07:54,758 --> 00:07:56,197","Yeah, actually I am!"
10,15,130,"00:07:56,197 --> 00:08:00,611",I guess I dropped the ball there. Whoopsie!
10,15,131,"00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:04,932","That's it? You know, it seems all you do lately is drop the ball."
10,15,132,"00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:07,716",Don't take that tone with me. Who you think you are?
10,15,133,"00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:12,516","Alan Lemond, the first black man to fly solo across the Atlantic?"
10,15,134,"00:08:15,012 --> 00:08:17,891","No, no, look.All I'm saying is that you're my agent, ok?"
10,15,135,"00:08:17,893 --> 00:08:20,388",And you're not getting me into any auditions and I'm tired of it.
10,15,136,"00:08:20,388 --> 00:08:21,731",What are you saying?
10,15,137,"00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:26,532","I'm saying thatThis isn't working for me anymore, ok?Estelle, you're fired. Goodbye."
10,15,138,"00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:34,691","Man, tough week for Estelle!"
10,15,139,"00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,996",Hi.Hi.
10,15,140,"00:08:36,996 --> 00:08:39,683",Emma left her stuffed t-rex at my house.
10,15,141,"00:08:39,684 --> 00:08:41,890",You know she can't sleep without it.
10,15,142,"00:08:41,892 --> 00:08:44,387","Oh, well, she's asleep now. Stop forcing that thing on her."
10,15,143,"00:08:44,387 --> 00:08:48,322",Ok.
10,15,144,"00:08:48,324 --> 00:08:50,627","Oh, you're not gonna believe what happened to me today!"
10,15,145,"00:08:50,628 --> 00:08:53,507","Ralph Lauren called, and gave me my job back!"
10,15,146,"00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:56,771",Nooo!
10,15,147,"00:08:56,772 --> 00:09:01,091","Yee. I mean, it was so weirdest thing.They fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back!"
10,15,148,"00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:04,355","I mean, that place must have been falling apart without me."
10,15,149,"00:09:04,356 --> 00:09:05,603","So, you're not going to Paris."
10,15,150,"00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:08,386","No, I'm still going."
10,15,151,"00:09:08,387 --> 00:09:13,186",Wh - wh - what?
10,15,152,"00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:17,602",When the Louis Vuitton people found out that Ralph Lauren wanted me back
10,15,153,"00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:22,402",- they offered me more money!Isn't that great?- Yeeeah!
10,15,154,"00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,881",Hi. We're buying the house next doorand we were wondering if we could just take a look around.
10,15,155,"00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:37,570","Oh, sure. I'm showing it to someone else right now but please, look around."
10,15,156,"00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:39,490",Thanks.
10,15,157,"00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,081",It feels like we're cheating on our house.
10,15,158,"00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:46,881","And if we're gonna cheat, shouldn't it be with like a hot younger house,that does stuff that our house won't do?"
10,15,159,"00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:52,161",Ours is so much better!
10,15,160,"00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:56,961","This living room is smaller, the dining room looks like a cave!What a hole!"
10,15,161,"00:09:57,634 --> 00:09:58,689",So? What do you think?
10,15,162,"00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,377",Love it!
10,15,163,"00:10:01,378 --> 00:10:05,313","Well, we already have one offer on itand I think the lady upstairs is goning to make another one."
10,15,164,"00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,233","They could be our neighbors, what are they like?"
10,15,165,"00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:11,647","Oh, the woman upstairs is very nice.She and her husband have two kids, he's on Wall Street and she -"
10,15,166,"00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:16,448",Oh my God!
10,15,167,"00:10:25,088 --> 00:10:29,887",Sure.
10,15,168,"00:10:31,425 --> 00:10:33,728","Hey Joey, want come with me to"
10,15,169,"00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:36,415",- are you ok?
10,15,170,"00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:41,215","Yeah, I just - I just feel bad about firing Estelle.This is got to be killing her."
10,15,171,"00:10:44,192 --> 00:10:48,991","No, that wouldn't kill her. Ordinary embolism might."
10,15,172,"00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:53,887","I don't know.She's got to be taking it hard, I was like her only client.Except for this guy who eats paper."
10,15,173,"00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:58,303",And I'm guessing he eats more money than he makes.
10,15,174,"00:10:58,303 --> 00:11:03,102","Look, I know she's not a great agent, but she did stick with me for ten years."
10,15,175,"00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:04,638",I'm gonna call her and hire her again.
10,15,176,"00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,439","No, no, no! Don't call her!You wait for her to call you"
10,15,177,"00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:14,430",- Why?- Because patience is the road to understanding
10,15,178,"00:11:16,543 --> 00:11:21,342",which ... is the key... to a happy heart.
10,15,179,"00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,757",You blow me away.
10,15,180,"00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,678","All right, so promise you're gonna wait for her to call you?"
10,15,181,"00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,478","I promise. And that means, never having to give a reason."
10,15,182,"00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:39,005",What a small world!
10,15,183,"00:11:39,006 --> 00:11:43,805",And yet I never run into Beyonc!
10,15,184,"00:11:43,807 --> 00:11:45,918",You two know each other?
10,15,185,"00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,414","Oh, we go way back. Before Monica made an honest man out of him"
10,15,186,"00:11:48,414 --> 00:11:53,213",Chandler used to be my little love muffin!heh-heh-heh!.
10,15,187,"00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,573",So? Are you guys thinking of getting this house too?
10,15,188,"00:11:56,574 --> 00:11:58,493",Ooh! Are we gonna have a bidding war?
10,15,189,"00:11:58,494 --> 00:12:02,908","I'd better warn you, I'm a toughie Don't, don't!"
10,15,190,"00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:04,444","No, actually, we're buying the house next door."
10,15,191,"00:12:04,446 --> 00:12:09,245",Why!?
10,15,192,"00:12:09,726 --> 00:12:12,221",I don't know why.
10,15,193,"00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:14,044","Ooh, that decides it then."
10,15,194,"00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:18,844",I was on the fence.But knowing that you two would be our neighbors?
10,15,195,"00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:25,180","Ah! now we have to get it! Ellen, we're going to talk numbers."
10,15,196,"00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:29,788",This can not be happening!
10,15,197,"00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:31,900","Okay, the realtor said another couple made an offer."
10,15,198,"00:12:31,901 --> 00:12:36,508",Maybe the Janice's won't get it! Maybe the other couple will.
10,15,199,"00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:41,308","The only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple are the Hitlers."
10,15,200,"00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:48,795","Okay, OkayAll right. What if we got both houses?Huh? We can turn this house into a guest house."
10,15,201,"00:12:48,796 --> 00:12:53,595","That is a great idea!And by the way, I don't mean to sound distastefulbut when did you start crapping money!?"
10,15,202,"00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,395","Okay, you come up with an idea."
10,15,203,"00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:02,426",Alright alrightwe still have three hours till escrow closes on our houseWe can still get out.
10,15,204,"00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,483",But we love our house.
10,15,205,"00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,403",Will we love it so much with her next door?
10,15,206,"00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:07,898",And she's gonna be louder out here too.
10,15,207,"00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,699","Just the crickets and ""Oh My God""!"
10,15,208,"00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:16,154","Okay, but if we don't get this houseshe's still gonna show up wherever we go!"
10,15,209,"00:13:16,156 --> 00:13:18,939","I mean, at least if she's here, it eliminates the element of surprise."
10,15,210,"00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,146","I mean, never again will you have to hear the three words .."
10,15,211,"00:13:21,148 --> 00:13:25,947",...that make your balls jump back up inside your body.
10,15,212,"00:13:29,882 --> 00:13:34,681","Well, we have to do something.We can't have her living next door."
10,15,213,"00:13:37,371 --> 00:13:42,170","Oh, that does it too."
10,15,214,"00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:47,354",Who is it?
10,15,215,"00:13:47,354 --> 00:13:51,289",It's me. Ron.
10,15,216,"00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,073","Look, I um, I now Rachel turned you down"
10,15,217,"00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:57,433",but I think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back.
10,15,218,"00:13:57,434 --> 00:14:02,233","This may surprise youbut re-hiring fired employees, is not my main job."
10,15,219,"00:14:03,962 --> 00:14:08,761",Just hear me out.How would you feel about offering her a raise?
10,15,220,"00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,824","Not good, Ron."
10,15,221,"00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:19,031",Perhaps I can persuade you.
10,15,222,"00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:21,336",What if you can give your son this genuine pterodactyl egg replica.
10,15,223,"00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:37,080","Wow, that's pretty cool"
10,15,224,"00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:40,440",Huh? So? We have a deal?
10,15,225,"00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:43,512","Okay, you got it.Yes! yes!"
10,15,226,"00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:45,718",This is gonna make me very popular.

10,15,239,"00:15:52,343 --> 00:15:56,662","Ok-ay. I just, I can't believe you're calling me?"
10,15,240,"00:15:56,663 --> 00:15:59,062","Well, I didn't think I should just drop by..."
10,15,241,"00:15:59,062 --> 00:16:03,381","No, no, no! Don't drop by, don't drop by!"
10,15,242,"00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:07,989","Anyway, you did what you had to do. I'm okay."
10,15,243,"00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,965",Can I ask you something?
10,15,244,"00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:13,748","Uhm, what's it like there?"

10,15,251,"00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:46,388",a-a-and I'll bet we get it.The Hitlers will be so disappointed.
10,15,252,"00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:50,323","All right, I got to run. Tell Monica I say goodbye."
10,15,253,"00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:53,492","And... I'll see you later, neighbor."
10,15,254,"00:16:53,492 --> 00:16:55,795",Wait! I just want you to know that...
10,15,255,"00:16:55,796 --> 00:17:00,019",I'm so happy you're going to be here.
10,15,256,"00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,131","Oh, me too..."
10,15,257,"00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:06,067",Because... that way...
10,15,258,"00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:10,867",we can pick up where we left off.
10,15,259,"00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:13,362",Huh?
10,15,260,"00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:15,667",I never stopped loving you.

10,15,265,"00:17:36,883 --> 00:17:41,682","Now that you live next door, we can be together every day.Sid and Monica never have to know a thing."
10,15,266,"00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:46,193",I don't know what to say...
10,15,267,"00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:50,994","I mean, you know, obviously we have this... heat between us."
10,15,268,"00:17:56,371 --> 00:17:59,346",Obviously.
10,15,269,"00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:04,145",But I love my husband. And I know you love your wife.
10,15,270,"00:18:04,338 --> 00:18:06,544","Now, I don't think we should get this house now."
10,15,271,"00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:11,345",Don't say that. Don't tangle the dream and take it away.
10,15,272,"00:18:11,346 --> 00:18:14,897","Chandler, one of us has got to be strong."
10,15,273,"00:18:14,897 --> 00:18:18,352",I understand.
10,15,274,"00:18:18,354 --> 00:18:22,192","Although, maybe just... one last moment of weakness..."

10,15,278,"00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:53,775",Hey!You are never going to believe what happened to me today.
10,15,279,"00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:54,736",What?
10,15,280,"00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:58,671",Ralph Lauren called again and they offered me more money.
10,15,281,"00:18:58,673 --> 00:19:02,128",They did?Yeah. It was the weirdest thing.
10,15,282,"00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:06,736",Zelner called me and he said we'll do everything we can to get you back.
10,15,283,"00:19:06,736 --> 00:19:11,535",And that I should thank some Ron...I don't even know what department that guy's in.
10,15,284,"00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:15,183","So, what are you gonna do?"
10,15,285,"00:19:15,184 --> 00:19:19,983","Well, I took it.That's great! So you're staying in New York!"
10,15,286,"00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,127","YAY! WHOO! YAY!You're excited, right?"
10,15,287,"00:19:26,128 --> 00:19:30,351","Ye-ah. Yeah! You know, the money's great.It's certainly the easier choice..."
10,15,288,"00:19:30,352 --> 00:19:32,079",Right!
10,15,289,"00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,687","Yeah, you know, was I looking forward to going to Paris?"
10,15,290,"00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:41,486","Sure. You know, was I excited about working in the fashion capital of the world?"
10,15,291,"00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:50,798","Ooh, absolutely...Oh...! Yeah, but you know, this is... it's fine."
10,15,292,"00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,622",I'm fine going back to a job where I've pretty much gotten everything out of that I possibly can...
10,15,293,"00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:57,422","Uhm, I hadn't no you..."
10,15,294,"00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,749",I had no idea you were so excited about Paris.
10,15,295,"00:20:09,902 --> 00:20:12,877","Uhm, I mean, you said you were scared."
10,15,296,"00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:15,470","Well yeah, but I mean, it was good scared though, you know?"
10,15,297,"00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,925",Like when I-moved-to-New-York scared.
10,15,298,"00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:23,725","Or uhm, when I-found-out-I-was-gonna-have-Emma scared..."
10,15,299,"00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:29,772",But this is... fine. This is gonna be good.
10,15,300,"00:20:34,574 --> 00:20:37,453",You should go.
10,15,301,"00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:40,620",What?
10,15,302,"00:20:40,622 --> 00:20:44,173",It's what you want. You should go.
10,15,303,"00:20:44,173 --> 00:20:46,956",You really think so?
10,15,304,"00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:50,124",I really do.
10,15,305,"00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,004",But I already told Zelner that I would come back...
10,15,306,"00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:57,804",I'm sure he'll understand.
10,15,307,"00:21:00,781 --> 00:21:04,236",All right. ALL RIGHT! I'm gonna do it.
10,15,308,"00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:08,171",I'm gonna go to Paris.

10,16,103,"00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:35,897",Now it just  hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional
10,16,104,"00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,761","... so no one say anything to set her off, okay?/Yeah."

10,16,111,"00:07:01,406 --> 00:07:06,092","I know, she's been such a big part of my life,and it feels like when ""Melrose Place"" got cancelled.I mean...Oh, forget about it. I miss ""Melrose Place""!"
10,16,112,"00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:22,966","- You know, I had a chance to stop her too!- Yeah? Who loses 57 coin tosses in a row?"

10,16,122,"00:08:08,202 --> 00:08:09,690","Hey, what do you think they're doing in there?"
10,16,123,"00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:15,445","Huh, if I had to guess I'd say Rachel's putting on the bubble wrap andPhoebe's doing the punching."
10,16,124,"00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:22,034","Oh, Pheebs, I don't even know where to start."
10,16,125,"00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:27,941","Okay well, before you do, I know we weren't supposedto get your ""going away"" presents,but I do have something for you."
10,16,126,"00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:31,764","Oh, oh. What is it?"
10,16,127,"00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:35,000","Well, it's cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it,"
10,16,128,"00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:43,113","... so that if they perfect the cloning process while you're over there,you can use the DNA to create your own Pheebs!"
10,16,129,"00:08:47,491 --> 00:08:54,012","I... I'm gonna throw this away,... but thank you so much for the gesture!"
10,16,130,"00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:56,153",Chandler?
10,16,131,"00:08:57,566 --> 00:09:02,136",I was just in our bedroomand I found these on my pillow.
10,16,132,"00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:08,588","Oh, yes. I decided to leave these out for you... in case Richard stops by and you wannaengage a little light bondage and mustache play!"
10,16,133,"00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:12,497",What are you talking about?These aren't mine.
10,16,134,"00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:16,432","Oh yeah, right!Good luck getting another scarf dance from me!"
10,16,135,"00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,871",That would be a terrible punishment.
10,16,136,"00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,632","- But I'm serious, I've never seen these before.- Really?"
10,16,137,"00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:27,114",Then what are they doing in our guest room?
10,16,138,"00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:28,986",Rachel used to live in that room.
10,16,139,"00:09:28,988 --> 00:09:34,337",Rachel... with handcuffs! Interesting!
10,16,140,"00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:39,339",Joey's bare ass!
10,16,141,"00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,472",Well Played.

10,16,143,"00:09:53,237 --> 00:09:58,738","Please, please don't... don't turn into... you know, French bitch!"
10,16,144,"00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:04,183","- Alright. Well, if I gonna do this, I'd better keep going.- Okay."
10,16,145,"00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:11,110",- Okay. Monica?- Yeah?- Can you come here with me for a minute?- Sure.
10,16,146,"00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:14,818",- Are you wearing waterproof mascara?- No.
10,16,147,"00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:17,388","No, you're so screwed."
10,16,148,"00:10:23,598 --> 00:10:25,757","Hey, what's that all about?"
10,16,149,"00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:29,526",She's gonna say goodbye to each of us individually.
10,16,150,"00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:32,438",Are you kidding? Oh my God...
10,16,151,"00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,042","Yeah, I know, it's gonna be even worse for you... God..."
10,16,152,"00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:38,069","Ross, get ready to do some serious crying."
10,16,153,"00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,997","Oh, man, I'm not gonna be able to handle this."
10,16,154,"00:10:43,118 --> 00:10:45,993",Now I know how my students feel at the end of each year.
10,16,155,"00:10:47,282 --> 00:10:51,499",And why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations.
10,16,156,"00:10:56,898 --> 00:11:04,132",Mon... Okay... I've gotta... just say what it is I'm gonna say...
10,16,157,"00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:12,295","None of the amazing things that happened to me in the last ten years,would've happened if it wasn't for you."
10,16,158,"00:11:14,305 --> 00:11:17,957",No one's been more like a sister to me.
10,16,159,"00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:22,830",I know what you mean.You are like a sister to me too.
10,16,160,"00:11:28,161 --> 00:11:31,170",I wouldn't know what I'm gonna do without you...
10,16,161,"00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:40,008",- You're the best friend I ever had.- (Says something that cannot be understood)
10,16,162,"00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:41,930",What?
10,16,163,"00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:49,130",I... I... I... (again says something that cannot be understood)
10,16,164,"00:11:49,847 --> 00:11:52,285",That is so sweet!
10,16,165,"00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:03,665","Oh no, she took down Monica...And I'm the cryer in the family."
10,16,166,"00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:07,139",Oh God! I could be next.
10,16,167,"00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:10,361",- Maybe she won't talk to me if itlooks like we're deep in conversation.- Okay.
10,16,168,"00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:15,810","Oh, so that thing you said about the thing. It reallymade me think about that other thing."
10,16,169,"00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:16,782","- Uh, Rach?- Yah?"
10,16,170,"00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:18,800",Well it's okay. Chandler's talking to her.
10,16,171,"00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:20,746",I really made you think about that thing uh?
10,16,172,"00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,945","Uh, Rach...I think I have something that belongs to you."
10,16,173,"00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:38,203","Oh, I'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that I don't get."
10,16,174,"00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:43,279","No, no, no... They are really yours.We... found them in your old room."
10,16,175,"00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,264","Well, these aren't mine."
10,16,176,"00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:45,993",Maybe Monica used to use them with...
10,16,177,"00:12:45,995 --> 00:12:46,963",Don't say Richard!
10,16,178,"00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:52,385","Well, if they are not Monica's and not yours,... then whose are they?"
10,16,179,"00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:56,328","Well, I think you're forgetting the kinkiest formerresident of that room."
10,16,180,"00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:57,849",Pheebs!Yeah!
10,16,181,"00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:02,257",I think these are yours.
10,16,182,"00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:07,465","These are not mine... Look how flimsy they are, come on!"
10,16,183,"00:13:08,093 --> 00:13:14,634","Good God! You try to hang a guy from a water pipe with these,they'll snap like a piece of licorice."
10,16,184,"00:13:16,714 --> 00:13:18,329",- Can I taIk to you alone for a minute?- Sure.
10,16,185,"00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:25,524","You don't really handcuff guys to water pipes, do you?"
10,16,186,"00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,111",Where do you think Mike really is?
10,16,187,"00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:38,824",- Oh honey...
10,16,188,"00:13:38,826 --> 00:13:45,225","- Let me just say something... Because once we get into this,I'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make somestupid joke..."
10,16,189,"00:13:47,464 --> 00:13:57,759","I just want to say that I...I love you.And, I'm gonna miss you.And I'm so sad that you're leaving."
10,16,190,"00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:07,231","Oh, you know what?Let's not say anything else.I love you."
10,16,191,"00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,737","Ooh, not so tight..."
10,16,192,"00:14:14,734 --> 00:14:16,452","- I'm sorry, just give me one more chance.- Okay. Oh..."
10,16,193,"00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,540","I'm sor... Just go. Just go. I can't, I can't."
10,16,194,"00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,290","So, I guess you are next.You are ready?"
10,16,195,"00:14:31,656 --> 00:14:32,716","- I don't think so.- Oh, you're definitely not."
10,16,196,"00:14:32,718 --> 00:14:35,798",I haven't cried like that in years.
10,16,197,"00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,068",You cried yesterday at the 6 o'clock news.
10,16,198,"00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:41,677",That old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.
10,16,199,"00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:48,172",God! I can't believe she saved me for last.Why are they taking so long?
10,16,200,"00:14:48,552 --> 00:14:53,217","- I dunno. But, God, Joey seems to be handling it surprisingly well."
10,16,201,"00:14:55,912 --> 00:14:56,743","- No, no, no, no!"
10,16,202,"00:15:05,456 --> 00:15:07,048","Okay, here we go..."
10,16,203,"00:15:08,886 --> 00:15:12,487",Oh... Well...Yeah...
10,16,204,"00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:19,835",I think I'm gonna to take off.
10,16,205,"00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:27,668","- Huh?- Oh, you guys. This was an amazing night. Thank you so much.I love you. Good night."
10,16,206,"00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:38,631",What?I don't get a goodbye?!
10,16,207,"00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,134",Lucky bustard!
10,16,208,"00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:51,128",Unbelievable!She says goodbye to everyone but me!
10,16,209,"00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:55,971","Well,maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be,you know, implicit."
10,16,210,"00:15:55,972 --> 00:15:58,271","Well, it needs to be plicit."
10,16,211,"00:15:59,945 --> 00:16:04,732","Alright, let's think about this.I mean, there's got to be an explanation.Uh... did you do anything to make her mad?"

10,16,213,"00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:11,274","You know, maybe she was just really spent from our talk.It's pretty intense."
10,16,214,"00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:12,283",- Yeah. Mine too.
10,16,215,"00:16:12,284 --> 00:16:13,119",- Mine was a humdinger.

10,16,219,"00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:29,340","Ross, if you're this upset, you should go and talk to her."
10,16,220,"00:16:29,341 --> 00:16:33,672","And say what? ""You owe me a goodbye"", I mean, he's got more pride than that."

10,16,229,"00:16:54,196 --> 00:16:56,254","Oh no, maybe it's me, I'm just not giving you enough credit."
10,16,230,"00:16:56,256 --> 00:17:00,591","Uh, I mean it is difficult to say goodbye to 5 people."
10,16,231,"00:17:00,593 --> 00:17:05,357","Uh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, good... (makes choking noises)It's physically impossible!"

10,16,235,"00:17:25,334 --> 00:17:26,152",- Tell me about it.
10,16,236,"00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:28,914","Well, you can't say we don't know how to throw a party."
10,16,237,"00:17:30,857 --> 00:17:32,263","Alright, I think I'm gonna head out."
10,16,238,"00:17:33,056 --> 00:17:34,603","Uh, where do you think you're going?"
10,16,239,"00:17:34,604 --> 00:17:39,715","I thought I was going home to go to bed, but I'm sensingthere's something less fun for me to do here?"
10,16,240,"00:17:41,164 --> 00:17:45,691",We are moving in a couple of daysand we've got a lot of packing to do.It'd be great if you guys could pitch in.

10,17,64,"00:05:07,032 --> 00:05:08,253",Like this..
10,17,65,"00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:17,033",- Come in.- Morning.

10,17,69,"00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,141",- Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.
10,17,70,"00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,803",- I did not see that coming.
10,17,71,"00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:35,038","- Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new houseyou know? It has that big backyard."
10,17,72,"00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,601","And then, when they get old,they can go to that special farm"
10,17,73,"00:05:37,782 --> 00:05:39,576",that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.
10,17,74,"00:05:41,917 --> 00:05:42,502",Yes!
10,17,75,"00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:45,280",- Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.

10,17,174,"00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:23,832",But I thought that was just mine and the baby's.
10,17,175,"00:11:24,311 --> 00:11:26,290",They kept saying both heartbeatsare really strong...
10,17,176,"00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,099","and I thought well, that'sgood 'cause I'm having a baby."

10,17,178,"00:11:32,356 --> 00:11:33,868",- Twins actually run in my family.
10,17,179,"00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:34,819",- Interesting!

10,17,190,"00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,179",- Why not?
10,17,191,"00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,577","We could give each of them half amedallion,"
10,17,192,"00:12:02,844 --> 00:12:05,252","and then years later,they'll find each other"
10,17,193,"00:12:07,951 --> 00:12:11,711","and be reunitedI mean, that's a great day for everybody."
10,17,194,"00:12:12,969 --> 00:12:15,817","- Okay, what if the person who adoptsthe other one is horrible?"
10,17,195,"00:12:15,957 --> 00:12:16,871",- What if they're not?
10,17,196,"00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,895",What if it's adopted by a king?
10,17,197,"00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,313","- Yeah, because I hear the kingis looking to adopt."

10,17,199,"00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:29,115",- That doesn't matter!We have waited so long for this.
10,17,200,"00:12:29,653 --> 00:12:32,472",I don't care if it's two babies.I don't care if it's three babies!
10,17,201,"00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:36,245","I don't care if the entire cast of""Eight is Enough"" comes out of there!"
10,17,202,"00:12:38,373 --> 00:12:40,807","We are taking them home,because they are our children!"
10,17,203,"00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:51,262",It looks like we're about ready over here.

10,17,210,"00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:16,463",- Oh my God!
10,17,211,"00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:20,834",- What did you say?- Nothing! What do you say to that?

10,17,217,"00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,524",She might not even go.
10,17,218,"00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:44,176",- You really think so?- I'm telling you!
10,17,219,"00:13:44,414 --> 00:13:48,860","Oh, okay! This is the part of the musicalwhere there'd be a really good convincing song."
10,17,220,"00:13:49,223 --> 00:13:51,847",<i>Don't take no for an answer.</i>
10,17,221,"00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:56,640",<i>- Don't let love fly away.</i>- Hi!
10,17,222,"00:13:57,135 --> 00:13:58,766",- Can't a girl finish a song around here?
10,17,223,"00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,991",- Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.
10,17,224,"00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:04,877","- Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?"
10,17,225,"00:14:05,252 --> 00:14:07,408","- No, we decided thatI would go ahead and set up first,"
10,17,226,"00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,661",and then my mom would bringEmma to Paris on Sunday.
10,17,227,"00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:12,371","- Wow, eight hour flight witha one-year old? Good luck, mom."
10,17,228,"00:14:12,847 --> 00:14:15,378",- Are you kidding?Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins?
10,17,229,"00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,295","Good luck, Emma!"
10,17,230,"00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:21,940","- Alright, you know what? You're right.I should at least tell her how I feel."
10,17,231,"00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:25,349","- Ross, wait, wait!- What? What?"
10,17,232,"00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:26,906",- Could you get me a muffin?
10,17,233,"00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:32,838",- Rachel ?- Yeah?
10,17,234,"00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:39,142","I know you're leaving tonight,...but I just have to tell you..."
10,17,235,"00:14:41,197 --> 00:14:42,028",...I love you.
10,17,236,"00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:48,025","I don't know if thatchanges your plans at all, but.."
10,17,237,"00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:52,505",...I thought you should know.
10,17,238,"00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,333",Gunther...
10,17,239,"00:14:58,436 --> 00:15:01,834","I love you too.Probably not in the same way,..."
10,17,240,"00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:04,128","...but I do. And,"
10,17,241,"00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,950","and when I'm in a caf, having coffee,"
10,17,242,"00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:11,529","or I see a man with hairbrighter than the sun,"
10,17,243,"00:15:13,514 --> 00:15:14,509",I'll think of you.
10,17,244,"00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,257",- Oh... Bye guys.- Bye.
10,17,245,"00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:28,394",- Oh my God!
10,17,246,"00:15:30,248 --> 00:15:31,459",- Unbelievable!
10,17,247,"00:15:32,846 --> 00:15:35,273","- Hey, you know what might help?- I'm not getting you a muffin!"
10,17,248,"00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:46,526",- Do you think they recognizeeach other from in there?
10,17,249,"00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:48,634",- Maybe.
10,17,250,"00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:50,558",Unless they're like two people
10,17,251,"00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:52,626","who have lived in apartmentsnext to each other for years,"
10,17,252,"00:15:52,805 --> 00:15:55,957","and then one day, they're pushedthrough a vagina and they meet."
10,17,253,"00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,765",We're going to take Erica to recovery now.
10,17,254,"00:16:00,744 --> 00:16:02,156",- There's something that we wanna tell you.
10,17,255,"00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:06,969",We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.
10,17,256,"00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,900","- Oh my God, that's just like my name!"
10,17,257,"00:16:13,968 --> 00:16:15,294","- Son of a gun, it is!"
10,17,258,"00:16:17,735 --> 00:16:19,335","- Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest."
10,17,259,"00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:22,803",I'm really glad I picked you guys.
10,17,260,"00:16:24,092 --> 00:16:25,615",You're gonna make great parents.
10,17,261,"00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:27,481",Even Chandler.
10,17,262,"00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,829","- Okay, well, bye!- Bye!"
10,17,263,"00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:33,701",- We'll call you!
10,17,264,"00:16:34,533 --> 00:16:35,807",- Have fun at church-camp!
10,17,265,"00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:44,755","- Oh, look at these little bunnies!- I know!"
10,17,266,"00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:47,818",You ready to trade?
10,17,267,"00:17:02,965 --> 00:17:03,851",- We could trade later.
10,17,268,"00:17:04,017 --> 00:17:04,667","- Yeah, I'm good."
10,17,269,"00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:09,941","- Hey, what are you working on?"
10,17,270,"00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:13,072","- It's a ""welcome home"" sign for the baby."
10,17,271,"00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,698","- How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?"
10,17,272,"00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:18,218","- No, I sat in the paint."
10,17,273,"00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:22,980","- Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?"
10,17,274,"00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,787","- No, and I'm not going to."
10,17,275,"00:17:26,106 --> 00:17:27,275",- What?- Why not?
10,17,276,"00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:29,228",- Because she's just going to shoot me down.
10,17,277,"00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:30,830",You guys saw what happened with Gunther.
10,17,278,"00:17:30,944 --> 00:17:32,153",That did not look like fun.
10,17,279,"00:17:32,463 --> 00:17:34,304",- How can you compare yourself to Gunther?
10,17,280,"00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,626","I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way."
10,17,281,"00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:42,025","You have a relationship with her,"
10,17,282,"00:17:42,142 --> 00:17:44,869","- you slept together last night!- Yeah, and she still wants to go!"
10,17,283,"00:17:45,813 --> 00:17:47,404",It's pretty clear where she is.
10,17,284,"00:17:48,315 --> 00:17:50,873","- Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...- Uh, Joe?"
10,17,285,"00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:51,821",- Damn it!
10,17,286,"00:17:53,645 --> 00:17:56,263","- Look, even if I were gonna tell her,I don't have to do it now."
10,17,287,"00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,370",Okay? I'll be seeing her again.We've got time.
10,17,288,"00:17:58,964 --> 00:18:01,405","-  No, you don't!She's going to Paris!"
10,17,289,"00:18:01,677 --> 00:18:03,307",She is going to meet somebody.
10,17,290,"00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:05,757",Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris?
10,17,291,"00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:07,914",It's... It's a city of Gunthers!
10,17,292,"00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,250",- Hey! What do you have there?
10,17,293,"00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:15,788","Oh, I made a little something."
10,17,294,"00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:18,020","If I had more time to work on it,it'd be better, but.."
10,17,295,"00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:22,705",- Oh my God! You did that yourself?
10,17,296,"00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,337","- Honey, that's gorgeous!."
10,17,297,"00:18:24,944 --> 00:18:26,607","- You know, the baby can't read, Mike!"
10,17,298,"00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:32,046","- Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here."
10,17,299,"00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:33,515",I can't believe they're not home yet!
10,17,300,"00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,533",I have to catch my stupid plane.I wanna see the baby!
10,17,301,"00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,248",- Monica just called from the cab.
10,17,302,"00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:39,776",She said they should be here any minute.
10,17,303,"00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:42,156","And apparently, there's some big surprise."
10,17,304,"00:18:42,459 --> 00:18:44,905","- Yeah, did she sound happy about it?'Cause my friend Ethel's baby..."
10,17,305,"00:18:45,027 --> 00:18:47,480","was born with a teeny, tiny beard."
10,17,306,"00:19:05,398 --> 00:19:07,562","Hey, so what is the big surprise?"
10,17,307,"00:19:12,984 --> 00:19:13,818",- Oh my God!
10,17,308,"00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:16,035","- Okay, okay, awkward question :"
10,17,309,"00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,544","The hospital knows you took two, right?"
10,17,310,"00:19:19,328 --> 00:19:20,462","- Yes, it's twins!"
10,17,311,"00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:22,385","- Oh, they're so cute!"
10,17,312,"00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:24,296","Now, what, what kinds are they?"
10,17,313,"00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,181","This is a boy,"
10,17,314,"00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:27,451",and that's a girl.
10,17,315,"00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,232",- Her name is Erica.
10,17,316,"00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,474","- Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica!"
10,17,317,"00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:36,877",- Yeah. It's a shame youtwo didn't get to spend more time together.
10,17,318,"00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:41,039","- Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad."
10,17,319,"00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,311","- Aw, he's gonna be so happy."
10,17,320,"00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:45,365","- Oh, Jack Bing. I love that."

10,17,322,"00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:49,852","Jack Bing, Morning Gazette :"
10,17,323,"00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,092","""I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"""

10,17,325,"00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:01,904",I want one.
10,17,326,"00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,232",- Oh yeah?
10,17,327,"00:20:03,894 --> 00:20:04,982","Well, tell me which one,"
10,17,328,"00:20:05,143 --> 00:20:06,284",and I'll try slip it in my coat.
10,17,329,"00:20:08,054 --> 00:20:09,619",Seriously.
10,17,330,"00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:11,227",Wanna make one of those?

10,17,333,"00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,028","- Ooh, we could teach them to sing,"
10,17,334,"00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:17,900",....and we can be like the Von Trapp family!
10,17,335,"00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,617",Only without the Nazis.
10,17,336,"00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:21,959",Although that sounds kinda dull.
10,17,337,"00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,361","- Oh, you guys, I can't believe this..."
10,17,338,"00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,984","... But I'll leave now,or I'm gonna miss my plane."
10,17,339,"00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:30,489",- I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.- Me too.
10,17,340,"00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,736","Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around"
10,17,341,"00:20:33,936 --> 00:20:35,616",to watch you two attempt to handle this!
10,17,342,"00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,107","Alright,"
10,17,343,"00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:41,019",I can't say goodbye to you guys again...

10,17,348,"00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:54,771",- I just want you to know..
10,17,349,"00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:57,259",... Last night..
10,17,350,"00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:01,286",...I'll never forget it.
10,17,351,"00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:04,171",- Neither will I.
10,17,352,"00:21:13,511 --> 00:21:14,765","- Alright, now I really have to go."
10,17,353,"00:21:15,717 --> 00:21:17,723","Ok. "" Au revoir ! ""."
10,17,354,"00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,672",they're gonna really hate me over there.
10,17,355,"00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,416","- So, you just let her go?"
10,17,356,"00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:29,033",- Yeah.
10,17,357,"00:21:30,876 --> 00:21:31,945","- Hey, maybe that's for the best."
10,17,358,"00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:34,453",- Yeah?- Yeah. You know?
10,17,359,"00:21:35,654 --> 00:21:38,371",You gotta think about last night
10,17,360,"00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:39,847","the way she does, okay?"
10,17,361,"00:21:40,642 --> 00:21:41,423",Maybe...
10,17,362,"00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:44,589",maybe sleeping together was..
10,17,363,"00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,487",the perfect way to say goodbye.
10,17,364,"00:21:49,026 --> 00:21:49,905",They slept together?
10,17,365,"00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,187",I was with you!
10,17,366,"00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:56,059",- But now she'll never know how he feels!
10,17,367,"00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:57,496",- Maybe that's okay. You know?
10,17,368,"00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:00,214","...Maybe, maybe it is better this way..."
10,17,369,"00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:04,240","I mean, now, now you can move on..."
10,17,370,"00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,610","...I mean, you've been trying to for so long,"
10,17,371,"00:22:08,214 --> 00:22:10,151",maybe now that you're on different continents..
10,17,372,"00:22:10,993 --> 00:22:11,953",Right?
10,17,373,"00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,655",- Maybe now you can actually do it.
10,17,374,"00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:20,007",You know? You can...
10,17,375,"00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:22,886",You can finally get over her.
10,17,376,"00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,124","- Yeah, that's true."

2,1,85,"00:05:18,718 --> 00:05:23,212","Isn't that just kick-you-in-the-crotch,spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
2,1,86,"00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,290",It's an expression.
2,1,87,"00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,489",We just wanted to say a quick hi.
2,1,88,"00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,357",- Then we'll see the baby.- Then get some sleep.
2,1,89,"00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,566","It's 6:00 tomorrow night, our time."
2,1,90,"00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,134",Don't tell us what's gonna happen.I like being surprised.
2,1,91,"00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:45,271",Bye!
2,1,92,"00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:58,851",- Can I get some coffee?- Sure.
2,1,93,"00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,354",- Did you talk to him yet?- No.
2,1,94,"00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:02,958","Then, no."
2,1,95,"00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,403",What the hell happened to you in China?
2,1,96,"00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,640","When last we left you,you were in love with, you know."
2,1,97,"00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,606",I know I was.
2,1,98,"00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,783",But there was always this voiceinside that kept saying:
2,1,99,"00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,215","""It's never gonna happen. Move on.""You know whose voice that was?"
2,1,100,"00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,014",God?
2,1,101,"00:06:33,426 --> 00:06:34,893","It was you, pal."
2,1,102,"00:06:35,862 --> 00:06:37,659",Maybe it was God doing me.
2,1,103,"00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,466",You were right. She looks at meand sees a friend. That's all.
2,1,104,"00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:49,569",And then I met Julie...
2,1,105,"00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,441",...and we're having a great time.
2,1,106,"00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,647","I never would have gone for it,if it hadn't been for you."
2,1,107,"00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,784","Well, you owe me one, big guy."
2,1,108,"00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,478",Your lemonade.
2,1,109,"00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,756",I didn't order it.
2,1,110,"00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,594",Then go take that back.They'll charge you for that.
2,1,111,"00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:11,361","Go, go, go! Come on, come on!"
2,1,112,"00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,598",So what did you find out?
2,1,113,"00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,766",He said...
2,1,114,"00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,503",He said...
2,1,115,"00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:24,334",They're having a great time.
2,1,116,"00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,678",I'm sorry.
2,1,117,"00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,307","But the silver lining,if you wanna see it..."
2,1,118,"00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,378",...is that he made this decisionall by himself...
2,1,119,"00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,989",...without any outside help whatsoever.
2,1,120,"00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,423",How is that a silver lining?
2,1,121,"00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,356",You have to really wanna see it.
2,1,122,"00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,027","Ironically, these guyswere picked last in gym."
2,1,123,"00:07:52,905 --> 00:07:54,031","Hey, Pheebs."
2,1,124,"00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,932",You know what I'm thinking?
2,1,125,"00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,080",How...
2,1,126,"00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:06,374",...it's been so longsince you've had sex...
2,1,127,"00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:09,482",...you're wonderingif they've changed it?
2,1,128,"00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:16,959",No. Although nowthat's what I'm thinking.
2,1,129,"00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,796",So what were you thinking?
2,1,130,"00:08:20,867 --> 00:08:25,531",You gave the guys great haircuts.I thought you'd like to do mine.
2,1,131,"00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:26,737",No.
2,1,132,"00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,471",Why not?
2,1,133,"00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,833",Because I'm just...
2,1,134,"00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,135",I'm incredibly anal andan unbelievable control freak.
2,1,135,"00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,305","No, you're not."
2,1,136,"00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,342","I know I'm not, but you are."
2,1,137,"00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:42,087",I was trying to spare your feelings.
2,1,138,"00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,188",Hold on.
2,1,139,"00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,388","Ross, Julie for you."
2,1,140,"00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,656",Anybody know a good tailor?
2,1,141,"00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,325",You need clothes altered?
2,1,142,"00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,960","No, I'm just looking for a manto draw on me with chalk."
2,1,143,"00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,060",Go see Frankie. My family'sbeen going to him forever.
2,1,144,"00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,199",He did my first suit when I was 15.
2,1,145,"00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,869","No, wait, 16."
2,1,146,"00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,835","No, excuse me, 15."
2,1,147,"00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:41,306","All right, when was 1990?"
2,1,148,"00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:46,750",You have to stop the Q-Tipwhen there's resistance!
2,1,149,"00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:57,458","Sweetheart, I'll see you later."
2,1,150,"00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,890","Okay, bye."
2,1,151,"00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:03,797",That is so sweet.

2,1,155,"00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,345",You didn't hang up either.
2,1,156,"00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,585",She didn't hang up.
2,1,157,"00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,554","No, you hang up."
2,1,158,"00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:31,159",You. You.

2,1,162,"00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,315","Hi, sweetie. I'm sorry.We got disconnected."
2,1,163,"00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,209","No, you hang up."
2,1,164,"00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,648",How did this happen to me?
2,1,165,"00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,255","A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine."
2,1,166,"00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,752",Ross was just Ross. Just this guy.
2,1,167,"00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:05,825","Now all of a sudden, he's Ross..."
2,1,168,"00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:10,135",...this really great guythat I can't have.
2,1,169,"00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,730","Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too."
2,1,170,"00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:14,304",I know you did.
2,1,171,"00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,472",I'm just gonna deal with it.
2,1,172,"00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,545",I gotta get out of here!
2,1,173,"00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:33,016","I don't care what you guys say,something's bothering her."
2,1,174,"00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,497","You know, I think I was 16."
2,1,175,"00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,302","Please, just a little bit off the back."
2,1,176,"00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,840","I'm still on ""no."""
2,1,177,"00:11:54,246 --> 00:11:55,110",Morning.
2,1,178,"00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,179",Could you close your eyes for a sec?
2,1,179,"00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,511","No, no, no. I'm notfalling for that again."
2,1,180,"00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:04,618",What's going on?
2,1,181,"00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,051",I sort of did a stupidthing last night.
2,1,182,"00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,022",What stupid thing did you do?
2,1,183,"00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,968",Why don't you just go get dressed...
2,1,184,"00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,563",...then you'll be on your way.Bye-bye.
2,1,185,"00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,367",How did this happen?
2,1,186,"00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:27,871",I kind of ran into him last night.
2,1,187,"00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,376",- Where?- At his apartment.
2,1,188,"00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,082",Is this juice?
2,1,189,"00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:35,447",And the fact that you dumped himbecause he hit on Phoebe?
2,1,190,"00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,882","Oh, God, I know.I'm pathetic, I'm a loser."
2,1,191,"00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,217","Honey, you're not pathetic.You're just sad."
2,1,192,"00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:44,759",People do stupid thingswhen they're upset.
2,1,193,"00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,090","My God, if I had a nickelfor every guy I wish I hadn't"
2,1,194,"00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:54,806",But this is aboutyour horrible mistake.
2,1,195,"00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:00,608",Sorry we're late.
2,1,196,"00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,174",We were...
2,1,197,"00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,348","Well, there was touching."
2,1,198,"00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,190","Hey, Ross!"
2,1,199,"00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,190",What a...
2,1,200,"00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,695",What are you doing here?
2,1,201,"00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,862",I do Raquel!
2,1,202,"00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,933",So he's back?
2,1,203,"00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,708","Yeah, he's back.Is that a problem?"
2,1,204,"00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,374","No, not a problem."
2,1,205,"00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,841",Good. Glad it's not a problem.
2,1,206,"00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,445",You're gonna have to not touch my ass.
2,1,207,"00:13:42,955 --> 00:13:45,981",Despite the yummy bagelsand palpable tension...
2,1,208,"00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,082",...my pants need to be altered.
2,1,209,"00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,727","When you see Frankie,tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello."
2,1,210,"00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,688",He'll know what it means.
2,1,211,"00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,897",You sure he'll crack that code?
2,1,212,"00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:04,165","It's funny. The last time Paolowas here, my hair was so much cuter."
2,1,213,"00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,309",All right.
2,1,214,"00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:11,646",But you have to promise that youwill not be all controlly and bossy...
2,1,215,"00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,852",...and all Monica about it.
2,1,216,"00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,354",I promise.
2,1,217,"00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:18,122","All right, let's see."
2,1,218,"00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:22,622","Now, some of you are gonna get cutand some of you aren't."
2,1,219,"00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,956","But I promise, none of youwill feel a thing."
2,1,220,"00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,244",- That's it. I quit.- What? I didn't say anything!
2,1,221,"00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:46,348",But this isn't the face ofa person who trusts a person.
2,1,222,"00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,849","This is the face ofa person who, you know..."
2,1,223,"00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,247",...doesn't trust a person.
2,1,224,"00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,921",I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
2,1,225,"00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,753",It's just a little shorterthan what we had discussed.
2,1,226,"00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:02,489",Would you relax?I know what I am doing.
2,1,227,"00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,295",This is how he wears it.
2,1,228,"00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:08,465",How who wears it?
2,1,229,"00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,867",Demi Moore.
2,1,230,"00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,905","Demi Moore is not a ""he."""
2,1,231,"00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:15,739","Well, he was a ""he""in Arthur and in 10."
2,1,232,"00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,275",That's Dudley Moore!
2,1,233,"00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,621",I said I wanted it like Demi Moore!
2,1,234,"00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:25,949","Oh, my God!"
2,1,235,"00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,150","Oh, God!"
2,1,236,"00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,354","Oh, my God! I'm sorry!"
2,1,237,"00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,324",Which one is Demi Moore?
2,1,238,"00:15:32,731 --> 00:15:38,067","She's the actress that was inDisclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost!"
2,1,239,"00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,601",She's got gorgeous hair.
2,1,240,"00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,463",I know!
2,1,241,"00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:05,057",How long do you want the cuffs?
2,1,242,"00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,830",At least as long as I have the pants.
2,1,243,"00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,003",I just got that.
2,1,244,"00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,503",Now we'll do your inseam.
2,1,245,"00:16:32,524 --> 00:16:33,286",How is she?
2,1,246,"00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,524",It's too soon to tell.
2,1,247,"00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,162","She's resting, which is a good sign."
2,1,248,"00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,364",How's the hair?
2,1,249,"00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,870",I'm not gonna lie to you.It doesn't look good.
2,1,250,"00:16:56,248 --> 00:17:00,275","I put a clip on one side, which seemsto have stopped the curling."
2,1,251,"00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,278",Can we see her?

2,2,77,"00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:47,178","Phoebe, listen. You were with me,and we were shopping all day."
2,2,78,"00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,705",We shopped and we had lunch.
2,2,79,"00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,108",What did I have?
2,2,80,"00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,116",- You had a salad.- No wonder I don't feel full.

2,2,87,"00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,968",You went shopping for fur?
2,2,88,"00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,706",And then I realizedthat I'm against that.
2,2,89,"00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,243",So then we bought some...
2,2,90,"00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:27,778",Boobs.

2,2,121,"00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,098","Did you just say, ""Hi, Jew""?"
2,2,122,"00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,636","Yes, I did."
2,2,123,"00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,941",That was my friend Eddie Moskowitz.
2,2,124,"00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,290","Yeah, he likes it.Reaffirms his faith."
2,2,125,"00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,702","Ben, dinner!"

2,2,128,"00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:05,876",I think I knowhow to heat breast milk.
2,2,129,"00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,708",What did you just do?
2,2,130,"00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,713","I licked my arm, what?"
2,2,131,"00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,148",It's breast milk!
2,2,132,"00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,649",So?
2,2,133,"00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:21,121","Phoebe, that is juicesqueezed from a person."
2,2,134,"00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,819",What is the big deal?
2,2,135,"00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:28,797",What did you just do?
2,2,136,"00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,304",Can people stopdrinking the breast milk?
2,2,137,"00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,500",You won't even taste it?
2,2,138,"00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,138",Not even if you justpretend it's milk?
2,2,139,"00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:45,608",Not even if Carol's breast hada picture of a missing child on it.
2,2,140,"00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:56,759",- Where is everybody?- At the park. Where have you been?
2,2,141,"00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:58,330",Just out.
2,2,142,"00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:02,864",Had some lunch. Just me.A little quality time with me.
2,2,143,"00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,965",- Thanks for your jacket.- No problem.
2,2,144,"00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,037","You can borrow it, by the way."
2,2,145,"00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,107","Here are your keys, honey."
2,2,146,"00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,915","If you were at lunch alone,how come it cost you $53?"
2,2,147,"00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,223",You know what probably happened?
2,2,148,"00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,419",Someone stole my credit card.
2,2,149,"00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,758",And put the receiptback in your pocket?
2,2,150,"00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:36,330","That is an excellent,excellent question."
2,2,151,"00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,168",That is excellent.
2,2,152,"00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:42,405",What's with you?Who did you have lunch with?
2,2,153,"00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:43,936",- Judy.- Who?
2,2,154,"00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,177",- Julie.- What?
2,2,155,"00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,775",Jody.
2,2,156,"00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,778",You were with Julie?
2,2,157,"00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,710","When it started, I was justtrying to be nice to her..."
2,2,158,"00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:57,581",...because she wasmy brother's girlfriend.
2,2,159,"00:10:58,024 --> 00:11:01,221",And then one thingled to another...
2,2,160,"00:11:01,894 --> 00:11:04,362","...and before I knew it, we were..."
2,2,161,"00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,364",...shopping.
2,2,162,"00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,235","Oh, my God!"
2,2,163,"00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,304","Wait, we only did it once."
2,2,164,"00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,069",It didn't meant anything to me!
2,2,165,"00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:26,447","Rachal, I was thinkingof you the whole time."
2,2,166,"00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,618","Look, I'm sorry, all right?I never meant for you to find out."
2,2,167,"00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,522","Oh, please! Please!You wanted to get caught!"
2,2,168,"00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,257",That is not true!
2,2,169,"00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,000",So you just happenedto leave it in here?
2,2,170,"00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:46,732",Did it ever occur to youthat I might just be that stupid?
2,2,171,"00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,938","Okay, I just have to know one thing."
2,2,172,"00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,839",Did you go with her to Bloomingdale's?
2,2,173,"00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,891","Okay, I just really needto not be with you right now."
2,2,174,"00:12:25,778 --> 00:12:26,802","Hi, who's this?"
2,2,175,"00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,171","Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working?It's Monica."
2,2,176,"00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,478","Yes, I know I did a horrible thing."
2,2,177,"00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,613","Joanne, it's notas simple as all that."
2,2,178,"00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,092","No, I don't care what Steve thinks.Hi, Steve."
2,2,179,"00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:48,626",How did we do?
2,2,180,"00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:51,528",I tasted Ben's milkand Ross freaked out.
2,2,181,"00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,531",I did not freak out.
2,2,182,"00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:57,003",- Why'd you freak out?- Because it's breast milk.
2,2,183,"00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,940",It's gross!
2,2,184,"00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,412",My breast milk is gross?
2,2,185,"00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,249",This should be fun.
2,2,186,"00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,015",There's nothing wrong with it.
2,2,187,"00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:12,918",I just don't thinkbreast milk is for adults.
2,2,188,"00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:16,456","Of course, the packaging doesappeal to grownups and kids."
2,2,189,"00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,631",Don't be silly. I've tried it.It's no big deal.
2,2,190,"00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:22,798",Just taste it.
2,2,191,"00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,434",That would be no.
2,2,192,"00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:28,328",- Come on.- Try it.
2,2,193,"00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,471",It's natural.
2,2,194,"00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,039",It doesn't taste bad.
2,2,195,"00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:34,176","Yeah, it tastes kind of sweet.Sort of like..."
2,2,196,"00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:35,209",Like what?
2,2,197,"00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,470",Cantaloupe juice.
2,2,198,"00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,080",Exactly.
2,2,199,"00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,814",You've tasted it.
2,2,200,"00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:48,993",You've tasted it.
2,2,201,"00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,127","Oh, you've tasted it."
2,2,202,"00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,236","You can keep saying it,but it won't stop being true."
2,2,203,"00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,576",Give me the bottle.
2,2,204,"00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,852",Get me the towel.
2,2,205,"00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:40,968",Howdy.
2,2,206,"00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,316",Give me a box of juice.
2,2,207,"00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,051","Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
2,2,208,"00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,287",Maybe it's because ofthe way you're dressed.
2,2,209,"00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,355",Or this guy's doing so goodthey want to put more people on it.
2,2,210,"00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,932",This guy goes throughtwo bottles a day now.
2,2,211,"00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,703",What do you care?
2,2,212,"00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,802",You're an actor.This is your day job. It's nothing!
2,2,213,"00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,543","I know, but I was the best."
2,2,214,"00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,871",You know? I liked being the best.
2,2,215,"00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,579",Maybe I should getout of the game.
2,2,216,"00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,253",They need guys up in housewaresto serve cheese.
2,2,217,"00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:27,584",Say you do that.
2,2,218,"00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,887","Sooner or later, somebody will comealong that slices a better cheddar."
2,2,219,"00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,523",Then where you gonna run?
2,2,220,"00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:36,800",You're right.
2,2,221,"00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,369",I say you show him what you're made of.Stand your ground.
2,2,222,"00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:45,201",Show him that you're the baddestHombre west of the lingerie!
2,2,223,"00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:48,002",- I'm gonna do it!- All right!
2,2,224,"00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,812","Now, go see Miss Kitty andshe'll fix you up with a nice hooker."
2,2,225,"00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,611",I don't know what to say.
2,2,226,"00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,220",That's good because I'm not listening.
2,2,227,"00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,722",I feel terrible. I really do.
2,2,228,"00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,225",I'm sorry.Did my back hurt your knife?
2,2,229,"00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:11,425",Say that I'm friends with her.Is that so terrible?
2,2,230,"00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,939",- It's that terrible?- You don't get it!
2,2,231,"00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,902",It's bad enoughshe stole the guy...

2,2,233,"00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,112",But now...
2,2,234,"00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,015",...she's actually...
2,2,235,"00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,578",But now she's actually stealing you!
2,2,236,"00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,120",What are you talking about?
2,2,237,"00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,823",Nobody could steal me from you.
2,2,238,"00:16:36,061 --> 00:16:40,464",Because I'm friends with her doesn'tmake me any less friends with you.
2,2,239,"00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,333",You're my...

6,2,64,"00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:57,883","I'm gonna be moving out, man."
6,2,65,"00:04:04,932 --> 00:04:08,925",I'm really happy for you guys.Congratulations. See you later.
6,2,66,"00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:10,961",Are you okay?
6,2,67,"00:04:11,172 --> 00:04:13,527",I gotta go. I've got an acting job.
6,2,68,"00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:16,806",Like you'd believe that.
6,2,69,"00:04:18,612 --> 00:04:19,727",This sucks!
6,2,70,"00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:22,726",I'll be across the hall.And I promise you. . .
6,2,71,"00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:26,322",". . .the minute Monica and I break up,I'm moving right back in."
6,2,72,"00:04:27,812 --> 00:04:29,723",If you're gonna move in with him. . .
6,2,73,"00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:33,163",. . .I feel it is my responsibilityto tell you the truth about him.
6,2,74,"00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:35,448",He's a terrible roommate. Terrible.
6,2,75,"00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:37,290",He forgets to. . . .
6,2,76,"00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,448","He always, he always. . . ."
6,2,77,"00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:43,403",Who am I kidding?He's the best roommate!
6,2,78,"00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:51,167","Hey, Pheebs.Have you seen Rachel?"
6,2,79,"00:04:51,372 --> 00:04:53,488","-No, why?-I have some exciting news."
6,2,80,"00:04:54,012 --> 00:04:55,127",You're pregnant.
6,2,81,"00:04:56,412 --> 00:04:57,891",No!
6,2,82,"00:04:58,932 --> 00:05:00,684",Chandler and I are moving in together.
6,2,83,"00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:02,371","Oh, that's good!"
6,2,84,"00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:06,127","But if you were pregnant,what would you name it? Hint, Phoebe."
6,2,85,"00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,120",What's up?
6,2,86,"00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,321",Chandler and I are moving in together.
6,2,87,"00:05:15,572 --> 00:05:17,608","Oh, my God."
6,2,88,"00:05:17,932 --> 00:05:21,322","Oh, my little sisterand my best friend. . ."

6,2,90,"00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:26,927",That's great. That's great.
6,2,91,"00:05:27,572 --> 00:05:28,925","Guys, I'm happy too."
6,2,92,"00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:30,525","Okay, come here."
6,2,93,"00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:35,929","Big day, huh? People moving in.People getting annulled."
6,2,94,"00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,769",I gotta go find Rachel.
6,2,95,"00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:45,130","If you see her, give her some reallybad news, so mine doesn't seem so bad."
6,2,96,"00:05:48,412 --> 00:05:50,687",Something bad to tell Rachel.
6,2,97,"00:05:52,372 --> 00:05:54,727",Bad news for Rachel.What could that be?
6,2,98,"00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:58,127","Can you just lay off, please?"
6,2,99,"00:05:58,372 --> 00:06:02,729",My life is an embarrassment. I shouldjust go live under somebody's stairs.
6,2,100,"00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,848",It's not that big a deal.You'll have been divorced three times.
6,2,101,"00:06:07,092 --> 00:06:09,048","You'll have a life, you'll date--"
6,2,102,"00:06:09,252 --> 00:06:13,245","No, I won't. I'll be at the bottomof the dating barrel now."
6,2,103,"00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:16,165",The only guys below mewill be Four-Divorce Guy. . .
6,2,104,"00:06:16,412 --> 00:06:18,323",. . .Murderer Guy. . .
6,2,105,"00:06:18,532 --> 00:06:20,170",. . .and geologists.
6,2,106,"00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:25,326","Ross, you're being ridiculous.You are cute and smart and sweet."
6,2,107,"00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:28,609",That is much more importantthan three stupid divorces.
6,2,108,"00:06:28,812 --> 00:06:31,690",Have you dated anyonewho's been divorced three times?
6,2,109,"00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:36,044",That's not fair. Most guys that havebeen divorced three times are 60.
6,2,110,"00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,127",Nobody cares about this except you.
6,2,111,"00:06:40,332 --> 00:06:43,529",This embarrassment thing isall in your head.
6,2,112,"00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:46,731","-Here, I'll show you. Come here.-What?"
6,2,113,"00:06:46,972 --> 00:06:50,931",Hi. My friend Ross is about to bedivorced for the third time.
6,2,114,"00:06:51,132 --> 00:06:52,531",But wouldn't you date him?
6,2,115,"00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,690","And if you wait right here,I'll go get Ross."
6,2,116,"00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:02,521",Thought you were Rachel.
6,2,117,"00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,724",What gave me away?
6,2,118,"00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,441",I gotta tell her.
6,2,119,"00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,842",I told Ross and Phoebe.She's the only one left.
6,2,120,"00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:11,566",It's official.We're moving in together.
6,2,121,"00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:15,009",No turning back.Are you scared? Are you?!
6,2,122,"00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,161",No.
6,2,123,"00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:19,363",That was my scariest voice.You're brave.
6,2,124,"00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:25,161",The worst day.
6,2,125,"00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:29,803","You're finally making progress at work,then your boss calls you Racquel."
6,2,126,"00:07:30,972 --> 00:07:34,931","Listen, for the first four yearsof my work, everybody called me. . . ."
6,2,127,"00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:42,923",-Seriously.-I believe you.
6,2,128,"00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:48,121","It was in the middle of a meeting,so no one wants to correct her."
6,2,129,"00:07:48,332 --> 00:07:49,970",So everyone's calling me Racquel.
6,2,130,"00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:53,727","By the end of the day, the mailroomguys were calling me Rocky."
6,2,131,"00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:58,722","Well, I still think you'revery, very nice and very pretty."
6,2,132,"00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:00,681",What?
6,2,133,"00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,771","All yours, babe."
6,2,134,"00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,641",Have a seat.
6,2,135,"00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:11,842","Listen, Chandler and l. . ."
6,2,136,"00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,324",. . .are going to live together.
6,2,137,"00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:15,681",Here.
6,2,138,"00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:20,007","Oh, my God."
6,2,139,"00:08:21,452 --> 00:08:22,931",That's so great!
6,2,140,"00:08:24,572 --> 00:08:26,881",I'm so happy for you guys!
6,2,141,"00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:28,127",Really?
6,2,142,"00:08:28,372 --> 00:08:30,602",And that was so sweet of you to ask.
6,2,143,"00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:34,521",The three of us are gonna havesuch a good time living together!
6,2,144,"00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:37,327","Yes, we are."
6,2,145,"00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:41,449","Chandler, you'll have to watchthose long showers you take. . ."
6,2,146,"00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:44,490",. . .because you knowRacquel can't be late.
6,2,147,"00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:47,400",He'll work on that.
6,2,148,"00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:50,724",This is so exciting!
6,2,149,"00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:55,962",Come and knock on our door
6,2,150,"00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:00,208",We'll be waiting for you
6,2,151,"00:09:03,692 --> 00:09:06,570","See? Once you know the stories,it's not that bad."
6,2,152,"00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:10,162",First marriage: Wife's hiddensexuality. Not my fault.
6,2,153,"00:09:11,252 --> 00:09:14,130",Second marriage:Said the wrong name at the altar.
6,2,154,"00:09:14,372 --> 00:09:16,010",A little my fault.
6,2,155,"00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:20,170",Third marriage: They shouldn'tlet you get married. . .
6,2,156,"00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:22,721",. . .when you're drunkand have writing on your face.
6,2,157,"00:09:22,932 --> 00:09:24,411",Nevada's fault.
6,2,158,"00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:29,680","So what do you think, ladies?Who wouldn't want to date him?"
6,2,159,"00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:32,242",The divorces don't bother me.I'd date him.
6,2,160,"00:09:32,492 --> 00:09:33,925",But not while he's still married.
6,2,161,"00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:36,083","And you, wouldn't you want to date?"
6,2,162,"00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:38,169",I'm not dating at all anymore.
6,2,163,"00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,926",I was only dating guysthat were bad for me.
6,2,164,"00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:42,571",So I decided that--
6,2,165,"00:09:42,772 --> 00:09:44,091",Good. Good. Whatever.
6,2,166,"00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:46,361","And you, Meg?"
6,2,167,"00:09:46,612 --> 00:09:49,285","Well, I don't care aboutthe divorces, either."
6,2,168,"00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,528",But I wouldn't date him.
6,2,169,"00:09:52,612 --> 00:09:56,127",It's just that he's obviouslystill in love with this Rachel girl.
6,2,170,"00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:57,168",What?
6,2,171,"00:09:57,612 --> 00:10:01,048","She said, ""He's obviously stillin love with this Rachel girl. """
6,2,172,"00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:06,969","This is crazy. I mean, yes,Rachel is my good friend."
6,2,173,"00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:09,726",And I have loved her in the past. . .
6,2,174,"00:10:09,972 --> 00:10:12,167",". . .but now, she is just my wife."
6,2,175,"00:10:14,372 --> 00:10:16,408","Phoebe, will you help me out here?"
6,2,176,"00:10:16,612 --> 00:10:19,524","Well, I thought you loved herwhen you married her."
6,2,177,"00:10:19,772 --> 00:10:24,004",We were drunk! I would've marriedJoey with that amount of alcohol.
6,2,178,"00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,532",You could do a lot worsethan Joey Tribbiani!
6,2,179,"00:10:29,972 --> 00:10:31,724","I'm sorry, but you guys are wrong."
6,2,180,"00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:35,049",I just don't wantto be divorced three times.
6,2,181,"00:10:35,252 --> 00:10:37,447",Now he's usingthis three-divorces reason. . .
6,2,182,"00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:40,809",. . .because he wants to stay marriedto her because he loves her.
6,2,183,"00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:43,361","I must say, well done. Bravo, Meg."
6,2,184,"00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,890","Fine. If this is what you think,forget about. . ."
6,2,185,"00:10:48,092 --> 00:10:49,525",. . .the whole three-divorce thing.
6,2,186,"00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:53,924",I'll go to my lawyer's office right nowand get this marriage annulled.
6,2,187,"00:10:54,132 --> 00:10:55,724",She means nothing to me.
6,2,188,"00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:57,769",Nothing!
6,2,189,"00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,121","Okay, now I wouldn't date youbecause you seem a little creepy."
6,2,190,"00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:05,642",I am so attracted to him right now.
6,2,191,"00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:13,531",When will we tell Rachelwhat actually will happen?
6,2,192,"00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:14,642",Soon.
6,2,193,"00:11:14,852 --> 00:11:17,525",I just couldn't before.You saw how upset Joey got.
6,2,194,"00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:20,002",I couldn't do it.She's my best friend.
6,2,195,"00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:21,645",Joey's my best friend.
6,2,196,"00:11:22,372 --> 00:11:24,328",I'm not your best friend?
6,2,197,"00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:26,966",You just said--!
6,2,198,"00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,528","Of course, you're my best friend."
6,2,199,"00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:32,680",Would you tell Rachel?
6,2,200,"00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,931",All right. At least I'm prepared.
6,2,201,"00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,925","Oh, yes."
6,2,202,"00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:43,446",-They're not for you. Are you upset?-I am now.
6,2,203,"00:11:46,212 --> 00:11:47,611","Hey, roomie."
6,2,204,"00:11:48,012 --> 00:11:49,604","Okay, bye."
6,2,205,"00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:57,882",There's something importantI have to tell you.
6,2,206,"00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,320",Are you pregnant?
6,2,207,"00:12:00,492 --> 00:12:02,289","No, but I'm throwing this shirt away."
6,2,208,"00:12:04,052 --> 00:12:07,124",I think there was a littlemisunderstanding before.
6,2,209,"00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:12,482",When I said that Chandler and Iwanted to live together. . .
6,2,210,"00:12:12,972 --> 00:12:15,805",. . .we meant alone together.
6,2,211,"00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:22,729","Oh, my God. That's funny.I can't believe I did that."
6,2,212,"00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:25,532","No, sweetie. You know what?This is my fault."
6,2,213,"00:12:25,772 --> 00:12:27,330",I wasn't clear.
6,2,214,"00:12:27,532 --> 00:12:29,488",I'm really sorry.
6,2,215,"00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:33,448","Listen, you take as much timeas you need to move out, okay?"
6,2,216,"00:12:33,692 --> 00:12:35,330",There's absolutely no rush.
6,2,217,"00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:37,721",Okay.
6,2,218,"00:12:44,412 --> 00:12:45,925",Don't you want a cookie?
6,2,219,"00:12:46,812 --> 00:12:47,927",Sure.
6,2,220,"00:12:50,332 --> 00:12:51,367",Thanks.
6,2,221,"00:12:51,612 --> 00:12:52,931",Do you need a tissue?
6,2,222,"00:12:56,812 --> 00:12:59,246",-Where did you get these?-I made them.
6,2,223,"00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:02,046","Oh, God, they're so yummy!"
6,2,224,"00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:08,768",It's gonna be weird when I come homeand you're not here.
6,2,225,"00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:10,724",No more Joey and Chan's.
6,2,226,"00:13:10,972 --> 00:13:13,042",No more J and C's.
6,2,227,"00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:16,529",Want to go to Joey and Chandler's?Can't. It's not there.
6,2,228,"00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,723",I'll be across the hall.We can still do all the same stuff.
6,2,229,"00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:23,691",We won't be able to havethose long talks at night. . .
6,2,230,"00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:25,769",. . .about our feelings and the future.
6,2,231,"00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:28,291",Not once did we do that.
6,2,232,"00:13:32,572 --> 00:13:35,564",I told Rachel that it's justgonna be the two of us.
6,2,233,"00:13:35,812 --> 00:13:38,007","Oh, yeah? Well, how'd she take it?"
6,2,234,"00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:39,726",Really well.
6,2,235,"00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:41,971",Surprisingly well.
6,2,236,"00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:45,284",She didn't cry.She wasn't angry or sad.
6,2,237,"00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:51,402",And you're upset because youdidn't make your best friend cry?
6,2,238,"00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:54,362",All I'm asking for isa little emotion.
6,2,239,"00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:56,648",Is that too much to askafter six years?
6,2,240,"00:13:56,892 --> 00:13:59,531","What, are Rachel and Inot as close as you guys?"
6,2,241,"00:13:59,732 --> 00:14:03,691","I mean, did we not have as much fun?Don't I deserve a few tears?"
6,2,242,"00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,963","When we told Joey,he cried his eyes out."
6,2,243,"00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:10,806",I did not cry my eyes out!
6,2,244,"00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:13,368","Come on, it's like the end of an era."
6,2,245,"00:14:13,612 --> 00:14:15,409",No more J-Man and Channy's!
6,2,246,"00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:19,562","Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?"
6,2,247,"00:14:25,892 --> 00:14:28,008",You got married again?
6,2,248,"00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:30,041",Yes.
6,2,249,"00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:34,288",So that's your second marriagein two years?
6,2,250,"00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:36,722",Yes. Second in two years.
6,2,251,"00:14:36,972 --> 00:14:39,202","Third, overall."
6,2,252,"00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:42,571",I have been a divorce attorneyfor 23 years. . .
6,2,253,"00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:45,770",. . .and never have I hadso much business from one client.
6,2,254,"00:14:47,612 --> 00:14:50,331",Why don't you tell me what happened?
6,2,255,"00:14:51,212 --> 00:14:54,841","Basically, Rachel and I werein Vegas, and we got drunk."
6,2,256,"00:14:55,052 --> 00:14:58,249","I'm sorry, is this the same Rachelwhose name you said. . ."
6,2,257,"00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:00,289",. . .at the altarin the second marriage?
6,2,258,"00:15:00,492 --> 00:15:02,130","Yes, yes, yes."
6,2,259,"00:15:02,492 --> 00:15:04,323",But I do not love her.
6,2,260,"00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:07,330",That's better then.
6,2,261,"00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:12,042","This was just a drunken mistake,and I need to get it annulled."
6,2,262,"00:15:12,252 --> 00:15:13,321",I see.
6,2,263,"00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:16,280",Have you considered therapy?
6,2,264,"00:15:18,132 --> 00:15:21,761",I think just the annulment for today.
6,2,265,"00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:24,247",-There are some forms to fill out.-Easy.
6,2,266,"00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:28,724",We'll need witnesses who can testifythat you were not of sound mind.
6,2,267,"00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,729",No problem.
6,2,268,"00:15:30,972 --> 00:15:34,009",We'll need you and Rachelto testify before a judge.
6,2,269,"00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:39,722",There's no way to do this without her?
6,2,270,"00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:43,681",Because I kind of already told herit was taken care of.
6,2,271,"00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:45,803",Of course you did.
6,2,272,"00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:51,810","Look, you can't get an annulmentunless you and Rachel are both there."
6,2,273,"00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:56,569",What about someonewho looks like Rachel?
6,2,274,"00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,969",I will think about the therapy.
6,2,275,"00:16:07,332 --> 00:16:11,530",So I was thinking that maybe weshould start dividing up our stuff.
6,2,276,"00:16:12,212 --> 00:16:13,531",Okay.
6,2,277,"00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:15,889",No point in dragging it out.
6,2,278,"00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:19,404",Dragging out the long processof you moving out. . .
6,2,279,"00:16:19,652 --> 00:16:21,688",. . .and us not living together anymore.
6,2,280,"00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:30,920",What about this? Who gets this?
6,2,281,"00:16:31,132 --> 00:16:34,727",I don't know if I want it becauseit might be too many memories.
6,2,282,"00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:37,811",-What is that?-I don't know.
6,2,283,"00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:43,925",How about this?I want you to have the big plate.
6,2,284,"00:16:44,932 --> 00:16:48,049","Wow, Monica, thanks.I love this plate."
6,2,285,"00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:51,045",Something to remember me by.
6,2,286,"00:16:52,292 --> 00:16:54,806","Mon, you're not dying.I'm just moving out."
6,2,287,"00:16:55,732 --> 00:16:58,121",We're gonna see each otherall the time.
6,2,288,"00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:01,165","But still, it's a big change."
6,2,289,"00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:04,404","The end of an era, you might say."
6,2,290,"00:17:07,212 --> 00:17:09,009",Are you okay? You're not blinking.
6,2,291,"00:17:10,172 --> 00:17:14,165",I'm fine. I was thinking abouthow it's an end of an era.
6,2,292,"00:17:14,612 --> 00:17:16,125","Oh, all right."
6,2,293,"00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:21,925","But I gotta say, I don't thinksix years counts as an era."
6,2,294,"00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:24,925",An era is defined asa significant period of time.
6,2,295,"00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:28,403",It was significant for me.Maybe it wasn't significant to you!
6,2,296,"00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:31,888",-What is the matter with you?-What is the matter with you?!
6,2,297,"00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,765",Why aren't you more upset?
6,2,298,"00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,924",Aren't you gonna be sadthat we're not living together?
6,2,299,"00:17:38,172 --> 00:17:40,049",Aren't you gonna miss me at all?
6,2,300,"00:17:40,372 --> 00:17:43,091","Monica, all right.But don't get mad at me."
6,2,301,"00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:47,246",It's just a little hard to believe.
6,2,302,"00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:49,325",What's hard to believe?
6,2,303,"00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:53,531","I mean, it's you guys.You do this kind of stuff, you know?"
6,2,304,"00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,685","You were gonna get married in Vegas,and then you backed out."
6,2,305,"00:17:57,932 --> 00:18:02,164",I'm not upset because I don't see yougoing through with it. I'm sorry.
6,2,306,"00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:09,929",It's going to happen.
6,2,307,"00:18:10,332 --> 00:18:11,685",Chandler will move in here.
6,2,308,"00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:14,645","-But l---I know, just let me finish, okay?"
6,2,309,"00:18:15,532 --> 00:18:19,161",This isn't something that we justimpulsively decided to do in Vegas.
6,2,310,"00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,801",This is somethingthat we both really want.
6,2,311,"00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:25,801",And it is going to happen.
6,2,312,"00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:27,931",It is?
6,2,313,"00:18:30,012 --> 00:18:31,240",Really?
6,2,314,"00:18:31,692 --> 00:18:33,284","Yeah, sweetie."
6,2,315,"00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:38,766","You mean, we're not gonnalive together anymore?"
6,2,316,"00:18:44,212 --> 00:18:46,851","Oh, my God.I'm gonna miss you so much."
6,2,317,"00:18:47,052 --> 00:18:48,770",I'm gonna miss you.
6,2,318,"00:18:49,972 --> 00:18:51,610","I mean, it's the end of an era!"
6,2,319,"00:18:51,812 --> 00:18:53,245",I know!
6,2,320,"00:18:56,532 --> 00:18:58,887","-Okay, bye.-Oh, no."
6,2,321,"00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,767",So did you get the annulment?
6,2,322,"00:19:01,972 --> 00:19:02,768",I couldn't.
6,2,323,"00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:04,963",I knew it. Because you love Rachel.
6,2,324,"00:19:05,732 --> 00:19:08,530",It's not that.Annulments are more complicated--
6,2,325,"00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,922",Complicated because of the love.
6,2,326,"00:19:11,372 --> 00:19:13,840",I do not love Rachel.
6,2,327,"00:19:14,092 --> 00:19:15,923",I'm telling herabout the whole thing. . .
6,2,328,"00:19:16,172 --> 00:19:19,244",. . .so we can get this marriageannulled as fast as possible.
6,2,329,"00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,369",Would I do that if I loved her?
6,2,330,"00:19:21,572 --> 00:19:24,405",I've never been more convincedof your love for her.
6,2,331,"00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:28,725","I do not have feelingsfor Rachel, okay?"
6,2,332,"00:19:31,772 --> 00:19:34,047","Oh, what's wrong?"
6,2,333,"00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,123",Monica and Chandler aremoving in here. . .
6,2,334,"00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:40,011",. . .and I have to move outand everything is changing.
6,2,335,"00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,522","Oh, my God, come here, come here.It's okay."
6,2,336,"00:19:43,812 --> 00:19:45,962",Everything's gonna be okay.
6,2,337,"00:19:46,172 --> 00:19:46,968",Thank you.
6,2,338,"00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:49,124",Of course.
6,2,339,"00:19:58,612 --> 00:20:01,763",So Ross and Rachel got married.
6,2,340,"00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:04,646",Monica and Chandleralmost got married.
6,2,341,"00:20:05,132 --> 00:20:06,645",You think we should hook up?
6,2,342,"00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:09,841","Oh, we do."
6,2,343,"00:20:10,092 --> 00:20:11,491",But not just yet.
6,2,344,"00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,803","Really? Well, when?"
6,2,345,"00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:20,570","Well, first Chandler and Monicawill get married. . ."
6,2,346,"00:20:20,812 --> 00:20:22,928",". . .and be filthy rich, by the way."
6,2,347,"00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:24,565",But it won't work out.
6,2,348,"00:20:25,252 --> 00:20:26,321",I know.
6,2,349,"00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:30,127",Then I'll marry Chandlerfor the money.

6,2,354,"00:20:41,492 --> 00:20:45,326",Getting custody will be easybecause of Rachel's drinking problem.
6,2,355,"00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:47,601",What about Ross?

6,5,93,"00:06:26,773 --> 00:06:31,369",This is so great. This is exactly howwe set the plates at the restaurant.

6,5,131,"00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:35,204",I don't know why I was so nervous. . .
6,5,132,"00:08:35,413 --> 00:08:38,325",. . .and why Frank and Alice complain.This is easy.
6,5,133,"00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:41,172","Yeah, two hours, a lifetime,that's the same."

6,5,136,"00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:52,288",That thing could putsomeone's eye out.
6,5,137,"00:08:52,493 --> 00:08:55,610",He can do more than that.He can destroy the universe.
6,5,138,"00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:59,051",They could swallowone of those little parts.
6,5,139,"00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:02,808","Also, look at his smooth area.That's just gonna mess them up."
6,5,140,"00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:06,412",They won't swallow anything.You're too overprotective.
6,5,141,"00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:10,162","When I was a kid, my mom used to throwme into a pile of broken glass."
6,5,142,"00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:14,210","-What?-Glass, sand, whatever."
6,5,143,"00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:18,647",Look at little Leslie stretchingin her sleep.
6,5,144,"00:09:18,893 --> 00:09:20,087","Oh, it's so cute."
6,5,145,"00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,171",I wonder when you stop puttingboth legs behind your head.
6,5,146,"00:09:23,373 --> 00:09:24,488",I can still do that.
6,5,147,"00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:28,408",How are you still single?
6,5,148,"00:09:30,293 --> 00:09:34,730","I thought about it, and maybe you'reright. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy."
6,5,149,"00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:38,608",-What made you change your mind?-I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.
6,5,150,"00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,205",How did that happen?
6,5,151,"00:09:41,693 --> 00:09:43,649",I was trying to provethat I was right.
6,5,152,"00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:46,204",And it turns out I was wrong. . .
6,5,153,"00:09:46,413 --> 00:09:48,404",. . .and now it's lodged in my throat.
6,5,154,"00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:55,532",This whole time we wereconcentrating on the babies. . .

6,7,52,"00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:31,246",Did you interview herbefore you asked her to move in?
6,7,53,"00:03:31,492 --> 00:03:32,368",Of course!
6,7,54,"00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,565",What did you ask her?
6,7,55,"00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:36,450",When can you move in?
6,7,56,"00:03:38,932 --> 00:03:41,685",Thank you for bringing herinto our lives.

6,7,60,"00:03:50,332 --> 00:03:52,482",I cannot wait to ask her out.
6,7,61,"00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:55,883",Wait a minute.You can't. She's your roommate.
6,7,62,"00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:57,451",It'll be too complicated.
6,7,63,"00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,091","Yeah, don't do it."
6,7,64,"00:03:59,332 --> 00:04:02,483","I mean, if you date her,then I can't date her."
6,7,65,"00:04:03,532 --> 00:04:06,842",Think about it. Rememberwhen you broke up with Donna. . .
6,7,66,"00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:10,243",. . .how horrible it was when youbumped into her at the supermarket?

6,7,72,"00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:28,250","Well, that's gonna be tough, Mon."
6,7,73,"00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:31,723",It's hard for me to be aroundan attractive woman and not flirt.
6,7,74,"00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,644","You're around me all the time,and you don't flirt."
6,7,75,"00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,801","A little sad about that, sweetie?"
6,7,76,"00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:47,249","I have to tie my shoes, so yougo ahead. I'll catch up."

6,7,81,"00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:11,602",Monica had such a crush on him.
6,7,82,"00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:16,130",She used to kiss his posterevery night before she went to bed.
6,7,83,"00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:17,487",I used to do that too!
6,7,84,"00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:20,929","Did you also have his album,""It's Not Easy Being Green""?"
6,7,85,"00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:24,529","Oh, Mon."
6,7,86,"00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:28,324","So Phoebe runs weird, huh?"
6,7,87,"00:05:28,932 --> 00:05:31,492",Yeah. And I know she'llwant to run again.
6,7,88,"00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:34,485","I don't know how to get out of it.I mean, I live with her."
6,7,89,"00:05:34,812 --> 00:05:37,690",Why don't you be straight with her?Tell her the truth.
6,7,90,"00:05:37,932 --> 00:05:41,242",You're right.I should just tell her the truth.
6,7,91,"00:05:42,452 --> 00:05:46,445","Pheebs, Monica tripped me. I don'tthink I can ever run again, ever!"
6,7,92,"00:05:47,932 --> 00:05:50,002",Why? Why would you do that?
6,7,93,"00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:51,362",I don't know.
6,7,94,"00:05:53,012 --> 00:05:55,082","Rachel, I'm sorry I hurt your ankles."
6,7,95,"00:05:55,452 --> 00:05:56,248",Ankle.
6,7,96,"00:05:56,452 --> 00:05:57,680",We'll see.
6,7,97,"00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:04,288",Okay. I am officially unpacked.
6,7,98,"00:06:04,532 --> 00:06:06,170","Thanks for helping me, man."
6,7,99,"00:06:07,052 --> 00:06:08,007",Joe?
6,7,100,"00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,482","Well, I guess Joey went home."
6,7,101,"00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:20,961","And look, there is still one boxI have to unpack."
6,7,102,"00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:25,520",I got you!
6,7,103,"00:06:27,212 --> 00:06:28,042","Oh, my God. . ."
6,7,104,"00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:30,288",. . .you almost gave mea heart attack.
6,7,105,"00:06:31,092 --> 00:06:33,401",It was so hard not to laugh.
6,7,106,"00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,248","Hey, the place looks great."
6,7,107,"00:06:36,492 --> 00:06:37,561","Not bad, right?"
6,7,108,"00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:41,441","Monica's working late,so I'm gonna make this place spotless."
6,7,109,"00:06:42,052 --> 00:06:43,280",You know what else I'll do?
6,7,110,"00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:46,285",I'm gonna go downstairsand get her some flowers.
6,7,111,"00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,284",Who wouldn't want to live with me?
6,7,112,"00:06:48,732 --> 00:06:49,801",I don't.
6,7,113,"00:06:50,492 --> 00:06:54,041","No, I want to live withthe super-hot Australian dancer!"
6,7,114,"00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:57,090",How's that going? Are you okaywith the not-flirting thing?
6,7,115,"00:06:57,332 --> 00:06:59,084",So far. But it's tough.
6,7,116,"00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:03,245","I've got this built-up flirting energy,and I don't know how to get rid of it."
6,7,117,"00:07:05,932 --> 00:07:07,809",How you doing?
6,7,118,"00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:14,050","Oh, man!"
6,7,119,"00:07:15,452 --> 00:07:17,682",Sorry. There's justmore room out here.
6,7,120,"00:07:17,932 --> 00:07:22,847","No, you just reminded methat I have to do my stretches too."
6,7,121,"00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:30,371",Why don't you try to be. . .?
6,7,122,"00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:32,965",-What's wrong?-Nothing.
6,7,123,"00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:34,884",I didn't want you to touch me. . .
6,7,124,"00:07:35,132 --> 00:07:38,090",. . .because I'm all sweatyfrom the workout.
6,7,125,"00:07:38,572 --> 00:07:39,891",I'm gonna hit the shower.
6,7,126,"00:07:42,932 --> 00:07:44,411","Oh, my God!"
6,7,127,"00:07:44,652 --> 00:07:46,483",Sorry about that stuffhanging in there.
6,7,128,"00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:49,451",It's just my thongs aretoo delicate for the dryer.
6,7,129,"00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:03,531","Oh, yeah, it's me."
6,7,130,"00:08:03,772 --> 00:08:06,730",I saw you grab your running shoesthis morning and sneak out.
6,7,131,"00:08:07,052 --> 00:08:09,088",You lied so you could run by yourself.
6,7,132,"00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:11,288","No, Phoebe, no. I was. . . ."
6,7,133,"00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,090",I was actually just checking. . .
6,7,134,"00:08:13,332 --> 00:08:14,367",. . .to see. . .
6,7,135,"00:08:14,612 --> 00:08:16,250",. . .if I could run. And I can!
6,7,136,"00:08:16,492 --> 00:08:17,891","Please, I'm not an idiot."
6,7,137,"00:08:18,132 --> 00:08:19,360","No, wait. Phoebe?"
6,7,138,"00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:34,365",Wow. Couples who live togetherdo start to look alike.
6,7,139,"00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:37,929","So, Mondler. . . ."
6,7,140,"00:08:40,652 --> 00:08:43,246",What are you doing?
6,7,141,"00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:45,562",What does it look like?I am cleaning.
6,7,142,"00:08:45,812 --> 00:08:48,963",Did you get Monica's authorizationto move all her stuff?
6,7,143,"00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:51,647",I don't need that.I'll put everything back.
6,7,144,"00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:54,042",Put it back exactlywhere you found it?
6,7,145,"00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:57,324",Yes. I'm gonna put it backexactly where I found it.
6,7,146,"00:08:57,652 --> 00:09:00,041","First of all,that attitude is not helping."
6,7,147,"00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:03,443",She won't care if I put her stuffback in the same stupid place.
6,7,148,"00:09:03,652 --> 00:09:07,042",Hello? Did you just meet Monica?
6,7,149,"00:09:08,052 --> 00:09:10,885",She'll recognizethat I did a nice thing. . .
6,7,150,"00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:12,724",. . .and appreciate it.
6,7,151,"00:09:13,372 --> 00:09:15,328","Actually, this will work out well."
6,7,152,"00:09:15,532 --> 00:09:17,363",Because when you move backwith Joey. . .
6,7,153,"00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:20,445",. . .Joey's hot new roommatecan come live with me.
6,7,154,"00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:23,441","Oh, I see. You're tryingto freak me out."
6,7,155,"00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:28,129","Chandler, Monica is really weirdabout this kind of stuff, all right?"
6,7,156,"00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:32,843","Believe me, I lived with her for1 6 years. She's going to freak out."
6,7,157,"00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,441","Oh, my God.She's going to sit on you."
6,7,158,"00:09:36,452 --> 00:09:38,568","No, she is not.I'll prove it to you."
6,7,159,"00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,450",I'll call her right now.
6,7,160,"00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:43,051",Phone's done.
6,7,161,"00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,049","-Hey, Mon. How's it going?-Terrible."
6,7,162,"00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:50,442","If I want something done right,I have to do it myself."
6,7,163,"00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,284",Other people just wreck stuff.
6,7,164,"00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,247",I think I might kill someone tonight.
6,7,165,"00:09:58,452 --> 00:10:00,647","Come on, it can't be that bad."
6,7,166,"00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,484",The only thing getting me through. . .
6,7,167,"00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,529",. . .is knowing I'll see you soon.
6,7,168,"00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:07,889",I might even tryto get out of here early.
6,7,169,"00:10:08,132 --> 00:10:09,850",It sounds like they need you there.
6,7,170,"00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:13,482","-You're just hanging out with Ross?-It's all good! Okay, bye!"
6,7,171,"00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:16,645",She's gonna kill me.
6,7,172,"00:10:17,212 --> 00:10:19,487",The phone was facing the other way.
6,7,173,"00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:22,522",And that goes back up there.
6,7,174,"00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:28,483",We should start with the big stuff.
6,7,175,"00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:32,042",That'll be the easiest.Let's start with the couch.
6,7,176,"00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:34,567",I got it.
6,7,177,"00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:40,129",That doesn't look right.
6,7,178,"00:10:40,372 --> 00:10:43,364",What are you talking about?The couch is in line with the carpet.
6,7,179,"00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:47,730",Then I can just walk over hereand casually put my feet up on. . . .
6,7,180,"00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,570","Okay, here's what we do."
6,7,181,"00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:53,087",We move the couchcloser to the coffee table.
6,7,182,"00:10:53,332 --> 00:10:56,165",But then the back of the couchwon't line up with the carpet.
6,7,183,"00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:59,370","Well, we'll just movethe coffee table. . ."
6,7,184,"00:10:59,612 --> 00:11:00,567",. . .closer to the couch.
6,7,185,"00:11:00,812 --> 00:11:05,727",But then the coffee tablewon't be centered in the seating area.
6,7,186,"00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,330",But the coffee table doesn'tmatch the table!
6,7,187,"00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:14,650","Look, what am I gonna do?"
6,7,188,"00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:19,204","I'm not flirting, but I'm drawingher to me like a moth to a flame!"
6,7,189,"00:11:24,292 --> 00:11:26,647",What the hell's going on over here?
6,7,190,"00:11:28,212 --> 00:11:29,531",Monica's gonna kill you!
6,7,191,"00:11:31,172 --> 00:11:32,287",I need your help.
6,7,192,"00:11:32,532 --> 00:11:35,968",I have to do somethingto repel this woman.
6,7,193,"00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:37,964",Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
6,7,194,"00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:39,930",You guys repel women all the time!
6,7,195,"00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,960","Hey, I've been married three times."
6,7,196,"00:11:49,812 --> 00:11:50,847","No, I've seen it happen."
6,7,197,"00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:54,721","You get a rapport going with a woman,but somehow you manage to kill it."
6,7,198,"00:11:56,012 --> 00:11:57,206",What's your secret?
6,7,199,"00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:00,848","We do not repel women, okay?"
6,7,200,"00:12:01,052 --> 00:12:02,690",That is completely untrue.
6,7,201,"00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:05,366","Oh, yes, we do, my man."
6,7,202,"00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:08,247",Remember when we went to a dance. . .
6,7,203,"00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:11,450",. . .and you walked up to that girlyou liked and talked. . .
6,7,204,"00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:14,047",. . .about the lrish potato famine?
6,7,205,"00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:17,765",What about you?You weren't so hot either.
6,7,206,"00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:20,207","After everything he said,he'd go--"
6,7,207,"00:12:22,812 --> 00:12:25,929",Monica doesn't like that either.I should stop doing that.
6,7,208,"00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:29,644",Girls don't like it whenI start talking about science.
6,7,209,"00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:31,962",That's not specific to girls.
6,7,210,"00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:35,681",This is great. What else?
6,7,211,"00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:37,650",They don't like you correctingtheir grammar.
6,7,212,"00:12:37,892 --> 00:12:41,168",And they don't like it when youexplain why your jokes are funny.
6,7,213,"00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:46,207",They don't like it when youkeep asking them if they like you.
6,7,214,"00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:50,801","-Man, I am so lucky I have Monica.-I'm never gonna find love again."
6,7,215,"00:12:55,892 --> 00:12:58,360",-Can I talk to you for a second?-Sure.
6,7,216,"00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:06,964","Phoebe, I just wanted to sayI'm sorry, okay?"
6,7,217,"00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:09,248",I handled the situation horribly.
6,7,218,"00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,767",And I should not have lied to you.
6,7,219,"00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,569",So what should you have done?
6,7,220,"00:13:14,932 --> 00:13:16,968",I should have told you the truth.
6,7,221,"00:13:17,932 --> 00:13:19,331",Which is?
6,7,222,"00:13:19,892 --> 00:13:24,568","Well, the reason I didn'twant to go running with you is. . ."
6,7,223,"00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:26,247",. . .because. . .
6,7,224,"00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:29,649",. . .the way that you runis just a little. . . .
6,7,225,"00:13:32,092 --> 00:13:33,491",-So?-It's embarrassing.
6,7,226,"00:13:33,732 --> 00:13:35,848",People were looking at uslike we were crazy.
6,7,227,"00:13:36,052 --> 00:13:38,771",-Why do you care?-Because they're people!
6,7,228,"00:13:39,332 --> 00:13:41,892",People you don't knowand will never see again.
6,7,229,"00:13:42,132 --> 00:13:44,168","Yes, but still they are people. . ."
6,7,230,"00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:45,640",. . .with eyes.
6,7,231,"00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:50,289",I didn't get embarrassedrunning next to Miss. . . .
6,7,232,"00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,360",But okay.
6,7,233,"00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:58,651",I can see why running with mewould be embarrassing to you.
6,7,234,"00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:00,444",Okay. You're uptight.
6,7,235,"00:14:00,652 --> 00:14:03,291",What? I am not uptight.
6,7,236,"00:14:05,092 --> 00:14:08,971","I am not uptight, man."
6,7,237,"00:14:10,732 --> 00:14:13,929",That's okay. I'm not judging you.That's just who you are.
6,7,238,"00:14:14,292 --> 00:14:17,443","I'm more free, you know.I run like I did when I was a kid. . ."
6,7,239,"00:14:17,692 --> 00:14:20,286",". . .because that's the only wayit's fun, you know?"
6,7,240,"00:14:20,532 --> 00:14:23,842",Didn't you ever run so fastyou thought your legs would fall off. . .
6,7,241,"00:14:24,052 --> 00:14:28,728",. . .Iike when you were running towardsthe swings or running away from Satan?
6,7,242,"00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:33,281",The neighbor's dog.
6,7,243,"00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:39,525",Is this in the right place?
6,7,244,"00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:41,848",Who cares? I repel women.
6,7,245,"00:14:45,212 --> 00:14:46,486",You can't come in here!
6,7,246,"00:14:46,732 --> 00:14:48,324",Ross is naked!
6,7,247,"00:14:53,652 --> 00:14:56,849","I couldn't say I was naked,because she's allowed to see me naked."
6,7,248,"00:14:57,052 --> 00:14:59,282",Why does anyone have to be naked?
6,7,249,"00:15:01,532 --> 00:15:03,443",Why is Ross naked?
6,7,250,"00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:09,481",I had to show Chandler something.
6,7,251,"00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,088",Naked?
6,7,252,"00:15:16,012 --> 00:15:17,843",I guess I have. . .
6,7,253,"00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,170",". . .a ""guy"" problem."
6,7,254,"00:15:21,852 --> 00:15:24,446",Is it the same thingChandler had?
6,7,255,"00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:31,691","We'll get everything squared away,and you can come back later!"
6,7,256,"00:15:31,892 --> 00:15:35,805",There's still some of Chandler'smedicine in the bathroom.
6,7,257,"00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:38,645",-Bye.-Bye!
6,7,258,"00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:45,601",Thank God.
6,7,259,"00:15:49,212 --> 00:15:50,804","Dude, what'd you have?"
6,7,260,"00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:55,131","We have no time, okay?We must focus."
6,7,261,"00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:58,045",We've got to get everythingback into its original place.
6,7,262,"00:15:58,252 --> 00:15:59,162",The photo album!
6,7,263,"00:15:59,412 --> 00:16:03,087",There were millions of picturesof the apartment in the photo album.
6,7,264,"00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:05,766",We just match everythingto the pictures!
6,7,265,"00:16:06,012 --> 00:16:08,207",That's perfect! That's brilliant!
6,7,266,"00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,121",What'd you have?
6,7,267,"00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:17,323",I've got some beer for you.
6,7,268,"00:16:18,612 --> 00:16:21,524","Don't you mean ""for whom""?"
6,7,269,"00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:24,481",Sure.
6,7,270,"00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:28,245",I was gonna order some pizza.You wanna share one?
6,7,271,"00:16:28,452 --> 00:16:31,649",Pizza? It's not like I neverhad that before.
6,7,272,"00:16:34,812 --> 00:16:36,006",Is something wrong?
6,7,273,"00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:39,084","All right, all right."
6,7,274,"00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,085","Let's just get thisout in the open, okay?"
6,7,275,"00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:43,208",You're hot.
6,7,276,"00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:45,762",I'm lovable.
6,7,277,"00:16:46,812 --> 00:16:50,282","Clearly, there's a vibegoing on between us."
6,7,278,"00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:51,647",But we're roommates. . .
6,7,279,"00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:55,362",. . .and it's a huge mistakefor us to continue down this road.
6,7,280,"00:16:56,652 --> 00:16:59,041",Imagine living in a supermarket. . .
6,7,281,"00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:00,605",. . .and you'll understand.
6,7,282,"00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:06,247","Okay? So the question is,what do we do?"
6,7,283,"00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:08,044",There isn't anything to do.
6,7,284,"00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,681",I think you're really sweet.
6,7,285,"00:17:10,892 --> 00:17:13,326",But I'm not interestedin you like that.
6,7,286,"00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:21,087","No, I mean. . . ."
6,7,287,"00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:26,762","You're a nice guy, and I'm happyto be your roommate and your friend."
6,7,288,"00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,889","I'm just, you know, I just. . ."
6,7,289,"00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:32,204",. . .don't feel that way about you.
6,7,290,"00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:36,766",I see what happened.
6,7,291,"00:17:37,332 --> 00:17:39,926",It's because I was tryingto repel you.
6,7,292,"00:17:40,132 --> 00:17:44,842","Right? Believe me, you'd feela lot different if I turned it on."
6,7,293,"00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:48,127","-I don't think so.-Oh, I do."
6,7,294,"00:17:51,092 --> 00:17:52,923",How you doing?
6,7,295,"00:17:54,852 --> 00:17:55,728",I'm okay.
6,7,296,"00:17:57,012 --> 00:17:57,808",What?
6,7,297,"00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:00,287",What?
6,7,298,"00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:03,009","Oh, dear God!"
6,7,299,"00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,246",I'm so sorry. You're right.This feels great!
6,7,300,"00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:30,246",And you don't care if people stare.It's only a second. Then you're gone!
6,7,301,"00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:34,642",It's amazing!I feel so free and so graceful!
6,7,302,"00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:41,251",Watch out for the horse.
6,7,303,"00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:49,085",Can I come in now?
6,7,304,"00:18:57,692 --> 00:18:59,922",-Why is everything different?-Bye.
6,7,305,"00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:04,251",I don't see anything different. . .
6,7,306,"00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:08,968",. . .other than the fact that the roomgot brighter when you came into it.
6,7,307,"00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:12,245","The end table is wrong,the couch looks bizarre. . ."
6,7,308,"00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:15,643",. . .and don't even get me startedon the refrigerator magnets.
6,7,309,"00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,051","Okay, don't be mad, okay?"
6,7,310,"00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:23,245","After I unpacked the boxes, I wantedto do something nice for you. . ."
6,7,311,"00:19:23,492 --> 00:19:26,245",. . .so I cleaned the apartment.
6,7,312,"00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:29,888","So I moved everything around,and then I forgot. . ."
6,7,313,"00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:33,249",". . .where it went back.I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry."
6,7,314,"00:19:34,892 --> 00:19:36,450",That's okay.
6,7,315,"00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,162",Are you afraid of me or something?
6,7,316,"00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,843",Do you want me to be afraid of you?
6,7,317,"00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,684",Of course not.
6,7,318,"00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:48,289","My gosh, Chandler, what you didis a wonderful thing. . ."
6,7,319,"00:19:48,532 --> 00:19:50,250",. . .and I really appreciate it.
6,7,320,"00:19:50,892 --> 00:19:53,770",I have this thing where I wanteverything in the perfect place.
6,7,321,"00:19:54,012 --> 00:19:56,321",But I'd never expect youto worry about that.
6,7,322,"00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:58,206",Really?
6,7,323,"00:19:58,972 --> 00:20:00,087",Of course.
6,7,324,"00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:02,491","Oh, you're the best."
6,7,325,"00:20:02,852 --> 00:20:04,365",You come here to me.
6,7,326,"00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,528","Hold on, okay?First things first."
6,7,327,"00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:12,050",Did Ross sit anywherewhile he was naked?
6,7,328,"00:20:17,212 --> 00:20:19,362",It said that by the year 2030. . .
6,7,329,"00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:22,649",. . .there'll be computers carryingout the same number of functions. . .

6,7,331,"00:20:25,092 --> 00:20:28,289","So, theoretically, you coulddownload your thoughts. . ."
6,7,332,"00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:30,648",. . .and your memoriesinto this computer--
6,7,333,"00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:33,127",And live forever as a machine.
6,7,334,"00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:40,764","Janine, do you knowwhat we're doing right now?"
6,7,335,"00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:44,646","You and l, we're interfacing."
6,7,9999,"00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,604",I gotta go.

6,9,208,"00:11:51,733 --> 00:11:55,692","""Oh, remember that Thanksgivingwhen Rachel screwed up the trifle?"""
6,9,209,"00:11:57,653 --> 00:12:01,282","Just let me worry about making it,and you just worry about eating it."
6,9,210,"00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:02,886","Oh, I am."

6,9,223,"00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:46,084",. . .and we still get to goto sweet potato pie.
6,9,224,"00:12:47,173 --> 00:12:49,004","Dude, they're not objects."

6,9,229,"00:13:09,773 --> 00:13:10,922",So. . . .
6,9,230,"00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:13,691",Thanksgiving.
6,9,231,"00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:18,809",The holiday season is upon us.

6,9,235,"00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:34,331",I don't think us getting backtogether is a good idea.
6,9,236,"00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,564",I thought this might happen today.
6,9,237,"00:13:39,773 --> 00:13:41,889",I know the holidays can be rough. . .
6,9,238,"00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:45,125",. . .and it's probably hardfor you to be alone right now.
6,9,239,"00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,402",You're alone.
6,9,240,"00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,490","No, I live with Phoebe."

6,9,242,"00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:57,292",And it's just not the timefor us. I'm sorry.
6,9,243,"00:13:58,053 --> 00:14:00,692","Oh, well.Can't blame a guy for trying."
6,9,244,"00:14:05,173 --> 00:14:07,607",And if anyone needs helppretending to like it. . .
6,9,245,"00:14:07,853 --> 00:14:11,687",. . .I learned some things in actingclass. Try rubbing your stomach.
6,9,246,"00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:15,681","Or saying ""Mmm. """
6,9,247,"00:14:16,093 --> 00:14:18,084",Smiling.
6,9,248,"00:14:19,853 --> 00:14:22,890",I'm not gonna payfor those acting classes anymore.
6,9,249,"00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:27,891","Rachel, there you are.Let's serve that dessert already!"
6,9,250,"00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:32,092","Joey, you have to stop rushing me.You don't get any dessert."
6,9,251,"00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,322",Really?
6,9,252,"00:14:34,693 --> 00:14:37,685","No, just kidding.I would never do that to you."
6,9,253,"00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:40,606","Okay, everybody, it's trifle time."
6,9,254,"00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:44,323","So, Rach, this is a traditionalEnglish trifle, isn't it?"
6,9,255,"00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:45,761",-It sure is.-Wow.
6,9,256,"00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,009",So did you make itwith beef or eggplant?
6,9,257,"00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:51,643",-Beef.-I can't have any. I don't eat meat.
6,9,258,"00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:58,166","Monica, I want youto have the first taste."
6,9,259,"00:14:58,773 --> 00:14:59,922",Really?
6,9,260,"00:15:03,293 --> 00:15:04,885","Wait, you only got whipped cream."
6,9,261,"00:15:05,133 --> 00:15:07,203",You gotta take a bitewith all the layers.
6,9,262,"00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,608",You dropped a pea.
6,9,263,"00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,088",Well?
6,9,264,"00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,766",It's good.
6,9,265,"00:15:34,493 --> 00:15:35,812",Really? How good?
6,9,266,"00:15:36,013 --> 00:15:37,924",It's so good that I feel selfish. . .
6,9,267,"00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:40,283",. . .about being the only onewho's eating it.
6,9,268,"00:15:40,493 --> 00:15:43,883",I think we should have everyonetaste how good it is.
6,9,269,"00:15:44,133 --> 00:15:46,089",Especially Ross.
6,9,270,"00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:56,123",This is so good that I'm gonnago enjoy it on the balcony.
6,9,271,"00:15:58,133 --> 00:16:02,012",So that I can enjoy the viewwhilst I enjoy my dessert.
6,9,272,"00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:05,131",I've gotta call my friend. . .
6,9,273,"00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,893",. . .and tell her how goodthis is from Monica's room.
6,9,274,"00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,327",I'll help dial.
6,9,275,"00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:13,725",I'm gonna go into the bathroom. . .
6,9,276,"00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,806",. . .so I can look at itin the mirror as I eat it.
6,9,277,"00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:21,527",What was that all about?Does it not taste good?
6,9,278,"00:16:21,733 --> 00:16:23,883","-Let me try it.-No, no!"
6,9,279,"00:16:28,773 --> 00:16:30,286",All gone!
6,9,280,"00:16:32,253 --> 00:16:33,891",So good.
6,9,281,"00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:37,092",Maybe Chandler has some left.
6,9,282,"00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:41,689",It tastes like feet.
6,9,283,"00:16:43,973 --> 00:16:45,292",I like it!
6,9,284,"00:16:48,733 --> 00:16:49,722",Are you kidding?
6,9,285,"00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:52,403","What's not to like? Custard, good."
6,9,286,"00:16:52,653 --> 00:16:55,690","Jam, good. Meat, good."
6,9,287,"00:16:57,973 --> 00:17:01,283",So a bird just grabbed it. . .
6,9,288,"00:17:03,493 --> 00:17:06,485",. . .and then triedto fly away with it. . .
6,9,289,"00:17:06,973 --> 00:17:09,203",. . .and then just dropped iton the street?
6,9,290,"00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,727","If it's any consolation,before the bird dropped it. . ."
6,9,291,"00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,924",. . .he seemed to enjoy it.
6,9,292,"00:17:17,573 --> 00:17:18,562","Rachel, come here."
6,9,293,"00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,963",I was taking my Thanksgiving napand I had another dream.
6,9,294,"00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:27,085","-Do I want to hear this?-I don't know, let's see."
6,9,295,"00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:30,330",I dreamt we were getting married. . .
6,9,296,"00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:33,286",. . .and he left becausehe had to go fight a fire.
6,9,297,"00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:36,883",So I went to a nightcluband I saw him making out with a girl.
6,9,298,"00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:39,852","Oh, my God, he dream-cheated on you!"
6,9,299,"00:17:40,373 --> 00:17:42,091",But then Jacques Cousteau came. . .
6,9,300,"00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:44,523",. . .and he kicked his assfor betraying me.
6,9,301,"00:17:44,773 --> 00:17:46,331",So cool!
6,9,302,"00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,730",Then he took me divingand introduced me to his sea horse. . .
6,9,303,"00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:54,171",". . .who was coming on to me.Please, that is not gonna happen."
6,9,304,"00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:59,850","Boy, I'm glad I worethe big belt today."
6,9,305,"00:18:01,773 --> 00:18:05,083","Five minutes ago, a line like thatwould have floored me."
6,9,306,"00:18:05,573 --> 00:18:09,122","But now, nothing. Well, not nothing.I am still a woman."
6,9,307,"00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:14,250",Ross? Let's go.
6,9,308,"00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,888","Oh, yeah.About telling Mom and Dad. . ."
6,9,309,"00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,812",. . .I was thinking aboutmaybe writing a letter.
6,9,310,"00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,129",That's it. You've had your chance.
6,9,311,"00:18:23,773 --> 00:18:27,368","Mom, Dad. Ross smoked pot in college."
6,9,312,"00:18:29,373 --> 00:18:31,682",You are such a tattletale!
6,9,313,"00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:35,891","Mom, Dad. . ."
6,9,314,"00:18:36,853 --> 00:18:39,686",. . .you remember that timeyou walked in my room. . .
6,9,315,"00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:41,605",. . .and smelled marijuana?
6,9,316,"00:18:41,813 --> 00:18:42,723",Yes.
6,9,317,"00:18:47,133 --> 00:18:48,885",I told you it was Chandler. . .
6,9,318,"00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:52,330",. . .who was smoking the pot but. . .
6,9,319,"00:18:54,093 --> 00:18:56,482",. . .it was me. I'm sorry.
6,9,320,"00:18:56,973 --> 00:18:57,962",It was you?
6,9,321,"00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,728","Dad, you know that mailmanthat you got fired?"
6,9,322,"00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:04,488",He didn't steal your Playboys.Ross did.
6,9,323,"00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:12,882","Well, Hurricane Gloria didn't breakthe porch swing. Monica did!"
6,9,324,"00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:17,961",Ross hasn't workedat the museum for a year!
6,9,325,"00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:22,126",Monica and Chandlerare living together!
6,9,326,"00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:28,852",Ross married Rachel in Vegas!And got divorced! Again!
6,9,327,"00:19:30,653 --> 00:19:32,530",I love Jacques Cousteau!
6,9,328,"00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:39,086",I wasn't supposedto put beef in the trifle!
6,9,329,"00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:41,882",I want to go!
6,9,330,"00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:48,731",That's a lot of informationto get in 30 seconds.
6,9,331,"00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,970","All right. Joey, if you wantto leave, just leave."
6,9,332,"00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:58,726","Rachel, no, you weren't supposedto put beef in the trifle."
6,9,333,"00:19:58,973 --> 00:20:00,850",It did not taste good.
6,9,334,"00:20:03,373 --> 00:20:05,329","Phoebe, I'm sorry. . ."
6,9,335,"00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:08,684",. . .but I thinkJacques Cousteau is dead.
6,9,336,"00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:12,925","Monica, why you feltyou had to hide the fact. . ."
6,9,337,"00:20:13,133 --> 00:20:15,886",. . .that you're in an importantrelationship is beyond me.
6,9,338,"00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,886",And we kind of figuredabout the porch swing.
6,9,339,"00:20:20,773 --> 00:20:21,842",Ross.
6,9,340,"00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,122",Drugs?

6,9,343,"00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:33,082",I got tricked into all those things.
6,9,344,"00:20:34,493 --> 00:20:39,089","Chandler, you've beenRoss' best friend all these years. . ."
6,9,345,"00:20:39,293 --> 00:20:42,012",. . .stuck by himduring the drug problems. . .
6,9,346,"00:20:44,213 --> 00:20:46,932",. . .and now you've taken onMonica as well.

6,12,135,"00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:52,891",Just trying to re-create some ofthe fun that we had at my place.
6,12,136,"00:07:53,132 --> 00:07:55,327",Remember? When you pickedRachel over me?
6,12,137,"00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,483",That was funny.
6,12,138,"00:07:58,172 --> 00:08:00,686",-It was kind of funny.-It wasn't funny at all!
6,12,139,"00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,724",Why would you do that?
6,12,140,"00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,803",Why didn't you pick me?
6,12,141,"00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,280",Fine.
6,12,142,"00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:11,486",The reason I was leaning a littlebit more toward Rachel than you. . .
6,12,143,"00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,489",". . .is just, you know, you're. . ."
6,12,144,"00:08:14,132 --> 00:08:16,123",. . .high maintenance.Let's go to lunch!
6,12,145,"00:08:16,372 --> 00:08:18,681",That is completely untrue.
6,12,146,"00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:21,127",You think I'm high maintenance?Prove it.
6,12,147,"00:08:21,372 --> 00:08:24,808","You write out a list, andwe'll go through it point by point."
6,12,148,"00:08:26,932 --> 00:08:28,923","No, you're right, you're easygoing."
6,12,149,"00:08:30,732 --> 00:08:34,202",You're just not as easygoingas Rachel. She's just more. . .
6,12,150,"00:08:34,452 --> 00:08:36,647",. . .flexible and mellow. That's all.
6,12,151,"00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:42,048","Well, people are different."
6,12,152,"00:08:43,092 --> 00:08:46,971",Rachel will do whatever you want.You can just walk all over her.
6,12,153,"00:08:48,052 --> 00:08:51,806",What? Are you saying that I'ma pushover? I'm not a pushover.
6,12,154,"00:08:52,092 --> 00:08:55,084","Oh, okay. You're not a pushover."
6,12,155,"00:08:56,572 --> 00:08:59,325","You think I'm a pushover.Well, watch this."
6,12,156,"00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:01,324",You're not invited to lunch!
6,12,157,"00:09:01,572 --> 00:09:03,927","What do you think?Pretty strong, I think."
6,12,158,"00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:06,288","Come on, Monica, let's go to lunch."
6,12,159,"00:09:08,452 --> 00:09:10,488",You start working on that list.
6,12,160,"00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:15,722",-I cannot believe her.-I know. Where do you want to eat?
6,12,161,"00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:20,287","-Oh, I love that Japanese place.-I'm sick of Japanese. Not there."
6,12,162,"00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:22,887",Wherever you want to go is cool.
6,12,163,"00:09:27,732 --> 00:09:28,926","Oh, hey, Gunther. . ."
6,12,164,"00:09:29,172 --> 00:09:30,685",. . .check this out.
6,12,165,"00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,681","Yeah, that Chandler cracks me up."
6,12,166,"00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:42,525",You want anything to drink?I'm heading up there.
6,12,167,"00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:45,048",-I'll take a coffee. Thanks.-Sure.
6,12,168,"00:09:45,612 --> 00:09:46,806",-Coffee?-No.
6,12,169,"00:09:47,052 --> 00:09:48,531",Coffee? I'm going up there.
6,12,170,"00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:49,926","No, thank you."
6,12,171,"00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:53,727",You need anything?I'm heading up there.
6,12,172,"00:09:54,172 --> 00:09:55,400",I'd love ice water.
6,12,173,"00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:57,085",You got it.
6,12,174,"00:09:58,412 --> 00:09:59,686",What are you doing?
6,12,175,"00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,206",Just being friendly.
6,12,176,"00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:05,761",You're not supposed to go back there.
6,12,177,"00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,331",It's okay. Right?
6,12,178,"00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,684",Don't wink at me.
6,12,179,"00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:13,689",And put on your apron.
6,12,180,"00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:16,766",Okay.
6,12,181,"00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:20,482",I don't see you asking otherpaying customers to put on aprons.
6,12,182,"00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:24,366","-Joey, do you work here?-No."
6,12,183,"00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,045",-Waiter.-Yeah!
6,12,184,"00:10:32,372 --> 00:10:35,125",What's going on?Why didn't you tell us you work here?
6,12,185,"00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:42,525","It's kind of embarrassing. I mean,I was an actor, now I'm a waiter."
6,12,186,"00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,888",It's supposed to gothe other direction.
6,12,187,"00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:48,286",So's your apron.You're wearing it like a cape.
6,12,188,"00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:52,530","I mean, the job's easyand the money's good, you know?"
6,12,189,"00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:56,526","I guess if I'm hanging out here,I might as well get paid for it."
6,12,190,"00:10:56,772 --> 00:10:59,844","I just feel kind of weirdserving you guys, you know?"
6,12,191,"00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:01,121",It'll be great.
6,12,192,"00:11:01,372 --> 00:11:03,681","Come on, I did it and it was fine."
6,12,193,"00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:05,325",Why would it be weird?
6,12,194,"00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:08,405","Hey, Joey? Can I get some coffee?"
6,12,195,"00:11:09,532 --> 00:11:11,488",It doesn't seem that weird.
6,12,196,"00:11:11,732 --> 00:11:14,292",I asked before.You still haven't gotten it.
6,12,197,"00:11:15,972 --> 00:11:18,088","See, now it's weird again."
6,12,198,"00:11:18,772 --> 00:11:22,048",You're gonna make a lot of money.Here's your first tip.
6,12,199,"00:11:23,372 --> 00:11:25,488",Don't eat yellow snow.
6,12,200,"00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:30,406","2: 1 5, coffeehouse."
6,12,201,"00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:35,284","This is great. Finally,someone I can pass my wisdom to."
6,12,202,"00:11:35,532 --> 00:11:38,330",Let me tell you some thingsI learned working here.
6,12,203,"00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,488","First, the customer is always right."
6,12,204,"00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:45,041",A smile goes a long way.
6,12,205,"00:11:46,732 --> 00:11:50,247","And if anyone is ever rude to you,sneeze muffin."
6,12,206,"00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:53,121","Thanks, Rach."
6,12,207,"00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:57,690","Hey, look, you guys are just terrific,you know?"
6,12,208,"00:11:57,932 --> 00:12:00,890",How about clearing outso I can get some new customers?
6,12,209,"00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:03,083",It's all about turnover.
6,12,210,"00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,049","Seriously, can I get my coffee?"
6,12,211,"00:12:09,492 --> 00:12:11,483",I'm sorry. I'll get it right now.
6,12,212,"00:12:11,972 --> 00:12:14,691","And since you waited,I'll toss in a free muffin."
6,12,213,"00:12:20,852 --> 00:12:22,763","Phoebe, we'd like to talk to you."
6,12,214,"00:12:23,292 --> 00:12:24,486",Okay.
6,12,215,"00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:27,730","So, maybe I ama little high maintenance."
6,12,216,"00:12:27,972 --> 00:12:30,725",And maybe Rachel isa little bit of a pushover.
6,12,217,"00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:32,564",But you know what you are?
6,12,218,"00:12:32,812 --> 00:12:36,361","We are sorry to tell you this,but you, Phoebe, are flaky."
6,12,219,"00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,410","That's true, I am flaky."
6,12,220,"00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:46,288","So, what, you're just okaywith being flaky?"
6,12,221,"00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:48,090","Yeah, totally."
6,12,222,"00:12:48,932 --> 00:12:51,321",Then I'm okaywith being high maintenance.
6,12,223,"00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:54,325",Yeah. And I am okaywith being a pushover.
6,12,224,"00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,802",That's great. Good for you guys.
6,12,225,"00:12:57,452 --> 00:13:00,091",-I am not high maintenance!-I am not a pushover!
6,12,226,"00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,688",-Who said you were?-You did!
6,12,227,"00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:06,167",I'm flaky. I'll say anything.
6,12,228,"00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:13,326","Hey, Gunther."
6,12,229,"00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:15,847",Can you cover for me?I got an audition.
6,12,230,"00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,481","No, I'm leaving to get my hair dyed."
6,12,231,"00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:22,044",I like your natural color.
6,12,232,"00:13:24,532 --> 00:13:27,808",It's a great part.I'm the lead guy's best friend.
6,12,233,"00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:30,282",I wait for him and save his seat.Listen.
6,12,234,"00:13:31,252 --> 00:13:33,482","""I'm sorry, that seat's saved. """
6,12,235,"00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:39,451",-That's the whole part?-Maybe he's not his best friend.
6,12,236,"00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:40,881",I'll see you.
6,12,237,"00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:43,685","Oh, man."
6,12,238,"00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:47,521","I could totally get that part.""I'm sorry, this seat is taken. """
6,12,239,"00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:50,923","-Excuse me.-No, I didn't mean you."
6,12,240,"00:13:51,172 --> 00:13:52,366",But you believed me?
6,12,241,"00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:56,289",I believed you were saving this seatfor someone.
6,12,242,"00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:58,531","So you'd hire me, right?"
6,12,243,"00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,290",For what?
6,12,244,"00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:04,412","Exactly!All right, everybody listen up!"
6,12,245,"00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:07,291",The coffeehouse will be closedfor about an hour.
6,12,246,"00:14:07,532 --> 00:14:09,568",What?
6,12,247,"00:14:10,012 --> 00:14:11,331",It's for the kids.
6,12,248,"00:14:11,572 --> 00:14:14,211","Yeah, to keep the kids off drugs."
6,12,249,"00:14:14,452 --> 00:14:17,888",It's a very important issuein this month's Playboy.
6,12,250,"00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:19,889",I'm sure you all read about it.
6,12,251,"00:14:29,972 --> 00:14:32,088",-It's my joke.-It's my joke.
6,12,252,"00:14:35,172 --> 00:14:36,924",It's my joke.
6,12,253,"00:14:38,372 --> 00:14:40,602",I don't think we're gonna settle this.
6,12,254,"00:14:41,732 --> 00:14:43,370",Let's have Monica decide.
6,12,255,"00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:45,565","-Hey, Mon!-Get out here!"
6,12,256,"00:14:45,812 --> 00:14:47,689",-Monica?-Okay.
6,12,257,"00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:50,122",You have to decide whose joke this is.
6,12,258,"00:14:50,332 --> 00:14:51,321",Why do I have to?
6,12,259,"00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:53,608",You're the only one that can be fair.
6,12,260,"00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,649",I can't be. You're my boyfriend.
6,12,261,"00:14:55,852 --> 00:14:57,888",But I'm your brother. We're family.
6,12,262,"00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:01,767",That's the most important thingin the world.
6,12,263,"00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:05,364",Don't try to sway her.
6,12,264,"00:15:05,732 --> 00:15:08,485",I'm your only chance to have a baby.
6,12,265,"00:15:12,172 --> 00:15:13,605","-Okay, let's go.-All right."
6,12,266,"00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:17,288",We'll each tell youhow we came up with the joke. . .
6,12,267,"00:15:17,532 --> 00:15:21,320",. . .then you decide which one of usis telling the truth. Me.
6,12,268,"00:15:22,012 --> 00:15:23,206","Chandler, you first."
6,12,269,"00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:26,683",I thought of the joke two months agoat lunch with Steve.
6,12,270,"00:15:26,932 --> 00:15:29,321",-Did I meet him at Christmas?-Can I finish?
6,12,271,"00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:30,971",You want me to pick you?
6,12,272,"00:15:32,172 --> 00:15:35,289","See, I would neversnap at you like that."
6,12,273,"00:15:37,092 --> 00:15:39,526",Two babies.
6,12,274,"00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,486",-Continue.-Okay.
6,12,275,"00:15:44,692 --> 00:15:49,208",Steve said he had to go to the doctor.And his doctor's name is Dr. Mompey.
6,12,276,"00:15:49,452 --> 00:15:54,287","I said, ""Dr. Monkey?"" And that is howthe whole Dr. Monkey thing came up."
6,12,277,"00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:00,010",Are you kidding?
6,12,278,"00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,001","Okay, look, I study evolution."
6,12,279,"00:16:03,252 --> 00:16:04,605",Remember? Evolution.
6,12,280,"00:16:04,852 --> 00:16:06,331",Monkey into man.
6,12,281,"00:16:06,572 --> 00:16:08,164","Plus, I'm a doctor. And. . ."
6,12,282,"00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:11,290",. . .I had a monkey.
6,12,283,"00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:15,203",I'm Dr. Monkey!
6,12,284,"00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,082",I'm not arguing with that.
6,12,285,"00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,368",I've heard enough for my decision.
6,12,286,"00:16:22,612 --> 00:16:24,125","-Okay, so what--?-Do tell."
6,12,287,"00:16:24,372 --> 00:16:26,442",You are both idiots.
6,12,288,"00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:30,520",It's not funny.And it's offensive to women.
6,12,289,"00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,808",And doctors. And monkeys.
6,12,290,"00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,208",You shouldn't argueover who gets credit.
6,12,291,"00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:41,082",You should argue over who gets blamedfor inflicting this joke on the world.
6,12,292,"00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:42,685","Now, let it go."
6,12,293,"00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:44,689",The joke sucks.

6,13,98,"00:05:56,212 --> 00:06:00,763",Charging clothes to your dad doesn'tqualify as making it on your own.
6,13,99,"00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:04,004","Oh, Mr. Scientist has to getall technical."
6,13,100,"00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:07,326",Rachel's not gonna thinkit's a good idea.

6,13,106,"00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:22,607",They did.
6,13,107,"00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:25,810","Yeah, we went shopping!"
6,13,108,"00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:29,611",You went shopping?
6,13,109,"00:06:29,812 --> 00:06:32,849",Then you came hereand paraded it under Jill's nose. . .
6,13,110,"00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:35,731",. . .when you know she's trying to quit.That's terrible.
6,13,111,"00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,125","Sorry, Jill."
6,13,112,"00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:41,611",So what'd you get?

6,13,116,"00:06:55,812 --> 00:06:56,801",Apartment pants?
6,13,117,"00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,605",You never heard of them?
6,13,118,"00:07:00,612 --> 00:07:02,489","Of course, I've heard of them."
6,13,119,"00:07:03,892 --> 00:07:05,405","Ross, what'd you get?"
6,13,120,"00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,967",I got this. . . .

6,13,125,"00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:25,766",What's a Pashmina?
6,13,126,"00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:28,566",It's a rug.
6,13,127,"00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:31,681",Jill?
6,13,128,"00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,448","I'm sorry, Rachel."
6,13,129,"00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,042",You think that's gonna work on me?
6,13,130,"00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:40,203",I invented that.
6,13,131,"00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:43,480",Right! But I am sorry.
6,13,132,"00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:47,052",It's okay.One little setback is okay.

6,13,134,"00:07:49,492 --> 00:07:50,447",Okay.
6,13,135,"00:07:50,652 --> 00:07:54,804","Now, since Daddy paid for all thisstuff, I should take it all away."
6,13,136,"00:07:55,012 --> 00:07:58,084",But I'm just gonna take the Pashmina.
6,13,137,"00:08:00,252 --> 00:08:02,402",And the pants.
6,13,138,"00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:06,767","I'll take it all, because that way,you'll learn the lesson."

6,14,171,"00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:03,887",That's Phoebe.Where did you get that?
6,14,172,"00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:06,407",At the adult video place on Bleecker.
6,14,173,"00:10:06,652 --> 00:10:11,123","And I saw Joey was about to go in,so I ran in ahead of him. . ."
6,14,174,"00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:14,603",. . .to surprise him.
6,14,175,"00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:18,811",Then I pretended that I didn'tknow he was in there.

6,14,178,"00:10:27,492 --> 00:10:30,643","Even Phoebe, who's always beensomewhat of a question mark."
6,14,179,"00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:33,843",This is so bizarre.
6,14,180,"00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:37,402",I guess it makes sense.She had such a terrible childhood.
6,14,181,"00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:39,802",I had a bad childhoodand I don't do porn.
6,14,182,"00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:42,924","Yes, but you're dead inside."

6,14,185,"00:10:47,292 --> 00:10:49,044",We can't watch it.It's Phoebe.
6,14,186,"00:10:50,172 --> 00:10:51,605",We shouldn't watch this.

6,14,189,"00:10:58,172 --> 00:11:00,845","This is wrong, you guys!Phoebe's our friend!"
6,14,190,"00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:03,208",-I'm not gonna watch it.-Yeah!
6,14,191,"00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:05,045","Good for you, Joe."

6,14,195,"00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:35,651",What's that on her ankle?
6,14,196,"00:11:35,892 --> 00:11:38,008",Her ankle is what you're watching?
6,14,197,"00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:41,401","Well, it's hard to tell."
6,14,198,"00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:44,482","God, if she would just stop moving."
6,14,199,"00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:47,088",She's just doing her job.
6,14,200,"00:11:47,492 --> 00:11:49,403",You sick bastards!
6,14,201,"00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:52,125",It's a tattoo.
6,14,202,"00:11:52,372 --> 00:11:54,408",That's weird. Phoebe doesn't--
6,14,203,"00:11:55,292 --> 00:11:58,568","Wait, that's Ursula!That's not Phoebe! That is Ursula!"
6,14,204,"00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:02,249","Wait, wait! I can watch that!Rewind it! Rewind it!"
6,14,205,"00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:05,200",Hey.

6,21,150,"00:09:04,172 --> 00:09:07,721","What I meant was are you still ""we""or are you just you?"
6,21,151,"00:09:09,052 --> 00:09:10,201",I'm just me.
6,21,152,"00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:13,486",My wife died shortly after Lizzie was born.

6,21,158,"00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:36,401",It was the guy who controls the robot.
6,21,159,"00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,962",He doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E.knock over the sandwich table...
6,21,160,"00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,168",...right when I was reaching for one.

6,21,182,"00:10:59,052 --> 00:11:02,089","You did. You came in, got all awkwardand ran to the bedroom."
6,21,183,"00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:03,844","You were shouting, ""Joey! """

6,21,188,"00:11:18,172 --> 00:11:22,131","You know, he lost his keys.So he was looking for them."
6,21,189,"00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:23,406",In your mouth?
6,21,190,"00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:26,808",No!
6,21,191,"00:11:27,572 --> 00:11:29,608",Downstairs. And we got to talking...
6,21,192,"00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:33,526",...for two hours. I liked him.I invited him for a cup of coffee.
6,21,193,"00:11:33,812 --> 00:11:36,042",You were at the coffee house!
6,21,194,"00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,521",What's the big deal? So I kissed the guy?
6,21,195,"00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:44,407",He's my girlfriend's father. It's weird!
6,21,196,"00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:48,042",-You dated my sister!-That was different!
6,21,197,"00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:51,169",-What? Why?-This is weird for me!
6,21,198,"00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:55,767","Ross, look. This is good for you."
6,21,199,"00:11:55,972 --> 00:11:58,691",Let's face it.So far the guy's not loving ya.
6,21,200,"00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:02,204",But I can turn that around.I've got the inside track.
6,21,201,"00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:05,684",We could all go out to dinner.And I could talk you up.
6,21,202,"00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:09,967",Plus the guy is a very successful lawyer!
6,21,203,"00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:13,566",-How is that important?-It's important!
6,21,204,"00:12:16,412 --> 00:12:19,165",There's a million guysout there who can play Mac...
6,21,205,"00:12:19,252 --> 00:12:20,605",...and there's only one robot.
6,21,206,"00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:24,287",And this one guy who controls it.I didn't know he could get me fired.
6,21,207,"00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:25,521",What am I gonna do?
6,21,208,"00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,206",You're a pretty charming guy.
6,21,209,"00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:31,007",Thanks. But I have a problem to deal with.
6,21,210,"00:12:31,092 --> 00:12:34,448","No, sweetie. You've got to win overthe guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E."
6,21,211,"00:12:34,532 --> 00:12:37,330",Go back thereand kiss some serious robot ass!
6,21,212,"00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:40,730",That's not a bad idea!
6,21,213,"00:12:41,412 --> 00:12:45,405","If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow,I'm not wasting any of it on you guys."
6,21,214,"00:12:46,252 --> 00:12:48,322","I got some saved for you, Pheebs."
6,21,215,"00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:54,767",Do you think Joey ismore charming than me?
6,21,216,"00:12:54,852 --> 00:12:57,320",Yeah. That's why I'm sleepingwith him on the side.
6,21,217,"00:12:57,412 --> 00:12:58,527",You wish.
6,21,218,"00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:03,607","""You wish."""

6,21,222,"00:13:14,372 --> 00:13:18,331",Fine. Then you know what?I will just write about Phyllis.

6,21,227,"00:13:38,292 --> 00:13:40,852",How's my favorite geniusand his robot buddy?
6,21,228,"00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:43,002",-Don't touch him!-Okay.
6,21,229,"00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:48,965",Level with me. I keep hearingall these rumors that I might get fired.
6,21,230,"00:13:49,252 --> 00:13:52,164",They even have actors coming into read for my part.
6,21,231,"00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,051","Come on, man.You gotta give me a second chance."
6,21,232,"00:13:55,132 --> 00:13:56,770",I love this little guy.

6,21,235,"00:14:08,572 --> 00:14:10,005","Hey, how are you doing?"
6,21,236,"00:14:15,652 --> 00:14:18,883",So it seemed that my prom datehad stood me up.
6,21,237,"00:14:19,252 --> 00:14:22,881",So Ross selflessly offered to take me.
6,21,238,"00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:25,005",What a nice story.
6,21,239,"00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:27,370",So Ross was in college...
6,21,240,"00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:31,320",...and decided to jump at the chanceto take a young girl to her prom.
6,21,241,"00:14:33,892 --> 00:14:36,884",I definitely did not see that one backfiring.
6,21,242,"00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:40,326",-I'm going to the bathroom.-Take your time.
6,21,243,"00:14:43,252 --> 00:14:47,370",I was a freshman and she was a senior.So it wasn't as bad as--
6,21,244,"00:14:47,572 --> 00:14:50,405",Look. I know I've been giving youa lot of jabs.
6,21,245,"00:14:51,532 --> 00:14:54,649",It's partly becauseI'm very protective of Lizzie...
6,21,246,"00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:58,722",...and partly becausethey just keep coming to me.
6,21,247,"00:15:01,212 --> 00:15:05,046",I have to admit that after allthe wonderful things Lizzie has told me...
6,21,248,"00:15:05,132 --> 00:15:08,647",...and the many storiesthat Rachel has told me...
6,21,249,"00:15:11,052 --> 00:15:12,121",...well...
6,21,250,"00:15:13,532 --> 00:15:14,851",...you're not...

6,21,256,"00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:38,529",-I beg your pardon?-I don't see her as a 12-year-old girl.

6,21,340,"00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:32,443",Wait. I just thought of another storyabout how nice Ross is.
6,21,341,"00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:35,126","That's okay, Rach.We're not liking Ross right now."
6,21,342,"00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:37,282","Well, I got a lot of those, too."
6,21,343,"00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:44,248","It turns out you were right, C.H.E.E.S.E."

6,22,3,"00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:06,245",What's the matter?
6,22,4,"00:00:06,332 --> 00:00:09,324","Well, it's just oneof these situations that I just hate."
6,22,5,"00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:12,006","You know,a massage client gave me three tickets..."
6,22,6,"00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:14,845",...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibitat the Morgan Chase Museum.
6,22,7,"00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,400",Now you're thinkingyou gotta sleep with him.
6,22,8,"00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:22,005","No, it's just that he gave me three ticketsand there are six of us."
6,22,9,"00:00:22,092 --> 00:00:24,162","-I'll give up my ticket.-Me, too."
6,22,10,"00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:26,691",Okay. That's so generous.
6,22,11,"00:00:26,772 --> 00:00:28,967","And I think Ross is generous, too."
6,22,12,"00:00:30,132 --> 00:00:32,043",Great! Okay. Then it's just us girls.
6,22,13,"00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,531",-Great.-Yeah.
6,22,14,"00:00:34,772 --> 00:00:36,330",So what is the exhibit?
6,22,15,"00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:38,846",It's mostly just photographs of...
6,22,16,"00:00:39,252 --> 00:00:43,928",...lesbian love scenes interspersedwith video games and free sandwiches.
6,22,17,"00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:48,680","Oh, man!"

6,22,20,"00:00:55,772 --> 00:00:59,765",Chandler got you out of going to thelesbian sandwich museum this weekend.
6,22,21,"00:01:01,212 --> 00:01:05,842",Thanks? But I have plans.Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
6,22,22,"00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:07,405",-That's great!-Yeah.
6,22,23,"00:01:07,492 --> 00:01:09,767",Think of all the moneythat you're gonna make!
6,22,24,"00:01:09,852 --> 00:01:10,807",Why? What?
6,22,25,"00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:13,725","Well, her father pays youfor babysitting, right?"
6,22,26,"00:01:15,172 --> 00:01:17,970","No, no. That's funny.But maybe it's time to move on."
6,22,27,"00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:19,963","You know, let it go. Stop it!"
6,22,28,"00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:23,126","Besides, Rachel's going outwith Elizabeth's father."
6,22,29,"00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:26,045",So he's much older than she is.
6,22,30,"00:01:26,452 --> 00:01:29,569",Looks like I'm not the only oneinterested in fossils.
6,22,31,"00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:35,567","Ross, all that does is remind usthat you are interested in fossils."
6,22,32,"00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:38,406","Okay, okay."
6,22,33,"00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:42,207",Rachel's gonna need to yell sweet nothingsin his ear.
6,22,34,"00:01:47,492 --> 00:01:49,881","-Ross?-Come on! That's funny, you know?"
6,22,35,"00:01:49,972 --> 00:01:52,611","'Cause he's got like a hearing aid,you know?"
6,22,36,"00:01:54,092 --> 00:01:56,162",'Cause he's all old.
6,22,37,"00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:04,520",One second.
6,22,38,"00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,650","Okay, look, Ross."
6,22,39,"00:02:09,172 --> 00:02:11,606","So you know,since Lizzie likes you so much..."
6,22,40,"00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:14,081",...l've accepted the factthat you two are dating.
6,22,41,"00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:15,844","Really? Okay, that's great."
6,22,42,"00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:18,127",Yeah. But then I changed my mind.
6,22,43,"00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:20,210",I'm funny like that.
6,22,44,"00:02:21,332 --> 00:02:23,243",I told Lizzie and now I'm telling you.
6,22,45,"00:02:23,332 --> 00:02:25,800",I don't want you seeingmy daughter anymore.
6,22,46,"00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:28,201","All right, look. I realize it upsets you."
6,22,47,"00:02:28,292 --> 00:02:29,486","Yes, it does."
6,22,48,"00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:34,444",But Elizabeth and I are both adults...
6,22,49,"00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:38,121",...so I don't think there's really anythingyou can do about it.
6,22,50,"00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:41,443","I'll inform the universityof your relationship, and have you fired."
6,22,51,"00:02:41,532 --> 00:02:43,329",A man with a plan!

6,22,113,"00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:34,731",-All right. Let's get me back up there.-No. You don't go up on the wall.
6,22,114,"00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:39,525",-What? But you saw the show.-Yes. It was very offensive to my people.
6,22,115,"00:06:41,812 --> 00:06:43,040",Dry cleaners?
6,22,116,"00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:48,524",Russians. It showed themas terrorists and villains.

6,22,120,"00:06:57,092 --> 00:06:58,445","Okay, that may be true."
6,22,121,"00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:02,684","But in Air Force One, okay,the Russians were terrorists and evil!"
6,22,122,"00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:06,208","And plus, he kills a bunch of them.That's offensive to Russians."
6,22,123,"00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,486",I've never seen it.
6,22,124,"00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:09,244",You should. It's great!
6,22,125,"00:07:14,812 --> 00:07:17,246",This place is really beautiful.
6,22,126,"00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:21,240",Yeah. I've been coming here since I wasa kid. This used to be my grandma's.
6,22,127,"00:07:21,332 --> 00:07:24,483",The only thing I gotfrom my grandmother was her eyes.
6,22,128,"00:07:24,972 --> 00:07:27,532","I mean, not her actual eyeballs."
6,22,129,"00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:30,371",But people say that my eyes look....
6,22,130,"00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:32,171",Do you want to make out?
6,22,131,"00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,241",Sure.

6,22,133,"00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,441",What's wrong?
6,22,134,"00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:43,410",Yeah. I was just thinkingabout your father.
6,22,135,"00:07:44,012 --> 00:07:45,650","Well, whatever works for you."
6,22,136,"00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:46,721",No.
6,22,137,"00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:53,004",He just really freaked me out before.
6,22,138,"00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:57,049",So we have to hide our relationshipfrom one more person.
6,22,139,"00:07:57,212 --> 00:07:58,247",Big deal.
6,22,140,"00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:00,681","Besides, we've had fun hiding it."
6,22,141,"00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:01,921",Yeah.

6,22,143,"00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,211",Why? Are there like bears or something?
6,22,144,"00:08:15,852 --> 00:08:19,242","Protection. Yeah. No, yeah.That, that I forgot."
6,22,145,"00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:24,207",-I'll just run to the store and get some.-No. I'm the guy. I'll get it.

6,22,147,"00:08:26,972 --> 00:08:30,362",Do you want to ride around townon my little pink bicycle?
6,22,148,"00:08:30,852 --> 00:08:32,126",A little bit.
6,22,149,"00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:35,364",-I'll be back in 10 minutes.-Okay.

6,23,133,"00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:29,368","-Remember, you were eating pizza?-Yeah."
6,23,134,"00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:35,527",Chandler's angry at us for not gettinghim a ticket to that Knicks game.
6,23,135,"00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:40,807",We were supposed to just get him one?That guy's always mooching off of us.
6,23,136,"00:08:42,412 --> 00:08:46,166","Anyway, I still think we shouldtry to patch things up."
6,23,137,"00:08:46,412 --> 00:08:49,449",We could get him tickets to anotherKnicks game and invite him.
6,23,138,"00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:53,571",That's a great idea.And I still have his credit card.
6,23,139,"00:08:54,012 --> 00:08:54,888",Here you go.
6,23,140,"00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:58,249","Hey, hey. I got this one.Here you go."
6,23,141,"00:08:59,252 --> 00:09:01,766",Sometimes I just don't get Chandler.
6,23,142,"00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:06,369","We do stuff all the time without you,and you don't get all upset."
6,23,143,"00:09:08,812 --> 00:09:11,167",-All the time?-All the time.
6,23,144,"00:09:13,092 --> 00:09:15,367","Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"
6,23,145,"00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:19,290",-Still crying?-Like a little girl.
6,23,146,"00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:23,480","I know, I know. This is all my fault."
6,23,147,"00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:25,404",I wanted him to open up.
6,23,148,"00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:28,086",I didn't know thatI was gonna unleash. . .
6,23,149,"00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:32,166",". . .this weepy, clingy,moist monster!"
6,23,150,"00:09:32,732 --> 00:09:35,690",I only know of two sure-fire waysto shut a man up.
6,23,151,"00:09:35,932 --> 00:09:36,887",One of them is sex.
6,23,152,"00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,330",-What's the other?-Don't know. Never had to use it.
6,23,153,"00:09:41,412 --> 00:09:44,882","I'm just saying, if we're having sex,he's not talking."
6,23,154,"00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:47,248",That's right. You're the talker.
6,23,155,"00:09:50,972 --> 00:09:52,485","Anyway, great idea."
6,23,156,"00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:55,801",I gotta buy him some more tissues.
6,23,157,"00:09:56,052 --> 00:09:58,168","-We have some here.-No, you don't!"
6,23,158,"00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:05,162",Okay. I'd also liketo try on the tiara.
6,23,159,"00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:08,605","Oh, yeah. Okay."
6,23,160,"00:10:10,932 --> 00:10:13,730",What do you think? Too much?
6,23,161,"00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:15,965",A tad.
6,23,162,"00:10:17,412 --> 00:10:19,562",Take the tiara back. . .
6,23,163,"00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,361",. . .and let me hold the musket again.
6,23,164,"00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:32,163",Something's missing.
6,23,165,"00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:35,485",Let me see the ring thatmy friend picked out.
6,23,166,"00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:38,767",Where's the 1 920s princess-cut ring?
6,23,167,"00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,122",I just sold it to that gentleman.
6,23,168,"00:10:41,372 --> 00:10:42,964","Oh, my God!"
6,23,169,"00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:44,770","Wait, no!"
6,23,170,"00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:51,169",Let me out! Now!
6,23,171,"00:10:56,852 --> 00:10:57,967",Rachel?
6,23,172,"00:10:58,252 --> 00:10:59,367",No.
6,23,173,"00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:02,966","-How are you, Paul?-Okay."
6,23,174,"00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:08,960",Chandler. . .
6,23,175,"00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,881",-. . .did your dad ever hug you?-No. Did he hug you?
6,23,176,"00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:16,810",No! No.
6,23,177,"00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:20,044",It's just that my dad never did.
6,23,178,"00:11:21,852 --> 00:11:22,841",I miss my dad.
6,23,179,"00:11:23,252 --> 00:11:26,164",You can see my dad in Vegaskissing other dads.
6,23,180,"00:11:31,372 --> 00:11:33,363","-Hey, Chandler?-Yeah?"
6,23,181,"00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:34,965",Would you. . .?
6,23,182,"00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:41,127",Would you hug me?
6,23,183,"00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:46,765","-I'm a little busy here, Paul.-That's what my dad used to say."
6,23,184,"00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:50,171","Okay. A quick one.Come on, hug it out."
6,23,185,"00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:53,565",There you go.
6,23,186,"00:11:54,652 --> 00:11:56,165",Okay.
6,23,187,"00:11:56,572 --> 00:11:58,563",-Five more seconds---Okay!
6,23,188,"00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,567","-Joey!-What? Hey, what--?"
6,23,189,"00:12:06,172 --> 00:12:08,163","Hi. Paul, is it?"

6,23,194,"00:12:24,132 --> 00:12:25,201",It'll be fun.
6,23,195,"00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:29,764","Me, you, Ross and. . . .Paul, probably."
6,23,196,"00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:35,842","Chandler, I found the perfect ring."
6,23,197,"00:12:36,092 --> 00:12:38,765",I'm gonna go withthe one I picked first.
6,23,198,"00:12:39,012 --> 00:12:42,607","Oh, wake up, Chandler. The oneyou picked is gone. It's over!"
6,23,199,"00:12:43,412 --> 00:12:44,242",What?
6,23,200,"00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:48,811",Some guy bought it. I tried to stophim but they put me in jail!
6,23,201,"00:12:50,052 --> 00:12:53,761",-They put you in jail?-The little jail between the doors!
6,23,202,"00:12:54,052 --> 00:12:57,089",-I asked you to guard the ring!-I know! I'm sorry.
6,23,203,"00:12:57,332 --> 00:13:01,007",But this ring is better. And Monicanever even saw the other ring.
6,23,204,"00:13:01,252 --> 00:13:05,530","Yeah. But when he proposed to mewith the ring, I got goosebumps."
6,23,205,"00:13:06,332 --> 00:13:08,607",-Maybe it was the guy.-It was the ring!
6,23,206,"00:13:11,372 --> 00:13:15,206",-Was he excited about the tickets?-No! He blew us off!
6,23,207,"00:13:15,452 --> 00:13:17,363",-What?-I know.
6,23,208,"00:13:17,652 --> 00:13:19,370",I can't believe it.
6,23,209,"00:13:19,852 --> 00:13:21,570",Can I tell you something?
6,23,210,"00:13:22,212 --> 00:13:24,168",I'm a little mad at him now!
6,23,211,"00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,369",Can I tell you something?
6,23,212,"00:13:28,932 --> 00:13:30,365",Me too!
6,23,213,"00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:35,405",He didn't want to talk to usabout being angry?
6,23,214,"00:13:35,652 --> 00:13:38,041",Maybe we don't talk to him at all!
6,23,215,"00:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,085",-Freeze him out.-Right!
6,23,216,"00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:43,731",-I like it.-We'll show him.
6,23,217,"00:13:43,972 --> 00:13:47,806","From now on, it's gonna beJoey and Ross, best friends."
6,23,218,"00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:50,842",We'll be the new Joey and Chandler.
6,23,219,"00:13:55,052 --> 00:13:56,451","Hi, I'm back."
6,23,220,"00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:58,603",I've written down more to tell you!
6,23,221,"00:13:58,852 --> 00:14:00,570","Oh, that's great."
6,23,222,"00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:04,766","No, actually, that's. . . ."
6,23,223,"00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:07,446",That's great. That's really great.
6,23,224,"00:14:07,692 --> 00:14:11,890","You know, I gotta tell you, writing,all that writing, it gets me. . . ."
6,23,225,"00:14:12,132 --> 00:14:14,805",It gets me kind of hot.
6,23,226,"00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:17,361","Wait, wait. Listen to this:"
6,23,227,"00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:20,971",Know what I wanted to be at that age?
6,23,228,"00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:22,561",A lover?
6,23,229,"00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:24,924",-A surfer.-A surfer?
6,23,230,"00:14:25,492 --> 00:14:28,609",-I wanted to be one with the waves---Hold on.
6,23,231,"00:14:28,852 --> 00:14:33,050",Let me just geta little more comfortable here.
6,23,232,"00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:34,281",Wait a second.
6,23,233,"00:14:34,532 --> 00:14:37,490","-This isn't too revealing, is it?-No."
6,23,234,"00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,561",Whatever happened to that little dude?
6,23,235,"00:14:41,772 --> 00:14:43,763",So full of dreams.
6,23,236,"00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:49,367",I don't care about the little dude!
6,23,237,"00:14:49,812 --> 00:14:52,690",I can't! I cannot listento any more of this!
6,23,238,"00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:56,163",The only one who'd listenis a mental health professional!
6,23,239,"00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:58,607",That's only becausethey get $1 00 an hour!
6,23,240,"00:14:58,852 --> 00:15:02,686",Do you know how much money I could'vemade listening to you? $2000!
6,23,241,"00:15:02,932 --> 00:15:05,765",Know when I figured that out?While you were talking!
6,23,242,"00:15:06,692 --> 00:15:10,651","I can't believe you're tryingto stifle me, when 1 4 hours ago. . ."
6,23,243,"00:15:10,892 --> 00:15:14,248",. . .we figured out that that's whatmy mother was trying to do to me!
6,23,244,"00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:16,971",I'm sorry.
6,23,245,"00:15:17,172 --> 00:15:20,767",I don't mean. . . .I didn't mean to stifle you.
6,23,246,"00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:24,165",This is all justa little overwhelming.
6,23,247,"00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:28,363",I'm so sorry.
6,23,248,"00:15:29,212 --> 00:15:30,850",I didn't mean to overwhelm you.
6,23,249,"00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:33,811",It's just thatwhen those gates open. . .
6,23,250,"00:15:34,652 --> 00:15:37,769",. . .it's hard to close them.
6,23,251,"00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,567",But they are closed now. Believe me.
6,23,252,"00:15:42,812 --> 00:15:46,361",I'm so glad. I'm so glad you shared.
6,23,253,"00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:49,366",And I'm glad that you're done.
6,23,254,"00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:53,967",So what do you say we. . . .
6,23,255,"00:15:56,092 --> 00:15:57,286",I'd really like that.
6,23,256,"00:16:08,612 --> 00:16:11,968",That was so good!
6,23,257,"00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:22,365","Oh, oh."
6,23,258,"00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:29,530",I can't believe you talked me intothis gumball-machine-looking ring.
6,23,259,"00:16:29,932 --> 00:16:33,368",It's not gumball machine-looking.It's a beautiful ring!
6,23,260,"00:16:33,572 --> 00:16:35,005","No, it's not."
6,23,261,"00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:38,688","When I looked at the other ring,I could see Monica's face. . ."
6,23,262,"00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:40,371",. . .and see her saying yes.
6,23,263,"00:16:40,572 --> 00:16:42,563","When I look at this,all I see is a ring."
6,23,264,"00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:46,970","Unless I look at it really closely,and then I can see my own eye."
6,23,265,"00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:56,362",This is the most important thing I'llever do. I want to make it perfect.
6,23,266,"00:16:57,372 --> 00:16:59,966",Maybe we could getthe other ring back.
6,23,267,"00:17:00,212 --> 00:17:02,806",I heard wherethe guy was gonna propose.
6,23,268,"00:17:03,052 --> 00:17:05,043",Maybe we could get him to trade rings.
6,23,269,"00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:06,645",I can't do that.
6,23,270,"00:17:07,012 --> 00:17:09,765",You certainly can't give herthat stupid gumball ring.
6,23,271,"00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,765",There he is.
6,23,272,"00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:22,611",He hasn't proposed yet.She has no ring on her finger.
6,23,273,"00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:26,561","Wow, you're good!After this, we should solve crimes."
6,23,274,"00:17:26,932 --> 00:17:28,001",Okay. Go get him.
6,23,275,"00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:29,687","Oh, okay."
6,23,276,"00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:36,047","Excuse me, sir. Could youcome with me? You have a phone call."
6,23,277,"00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:38,649",-Who is it?-It is your office.
6,23,278,"00:17:38,972 --> 00:17:41,167",-Do you know who at my office?-John.
6,23,279,"00:17:41,412 --> 00:17:42,447","Oh, John! Great!"
6,23,280,"00:17:46,052 --> 00:17:47,849",-There he is.-Hi. Okay.
6,23,281,"00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,969",There was a mix-up at the store.
6,23,282,"00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:53,363",The ring you have was supposedto be held for me.
6,23,283,"00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:55,682",I'm gonna need to have that back.
6,23,284,"00:17:57,612 --> 00:18:02,163","In exchange, I'm willing to trade youthis beautiful, more expensive ring."
6,23,285,"00:18:04,332 --> 00:18:06,050","Wow, I would trade."
6,23,286,"00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:10,842","It is beautiful, but I'm gonna usethis one. Excuse me."
6,23,287,"00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:14,289","This is my fiance,and her heart was set on that ring."
6,23,288,"00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:16,170",Do you want to break her heart?
6,23,289,"00:18:16,652 --> 00:18:19,724",Yeah. Do you want to breaka dying woman's heart?
6,23,290,"00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:21,965",You're dying?

6,24,122,"00:08:15,332 --> 00:08:17,971",I'm a little cold.Can I have your jacket?
6,24,123,"00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:21,571","No, you can't have my jacket."
6,24,124,"00:08:22,412 --> 00:08:24,562",Because then I would be cold.
6,24,125,"00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:28,767","If you thought you'd be cold,you should have brought a jacket."
6,24,126,"00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:31,889","Other than that, are you okay?"
6,24,127,"00:08:34,172 --> 00:08:35,571",Are you sure you're okay?
6,24,128,"00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:38,367",Yes. I'm fine.
6,24,129,"00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:43,481","In fact, I've been finefor a long time now and I think. . ."
6,24,130,"00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,085",. . .the reason is you.
6,24,131,"00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:47,487",That's sweet.
6,24,132,"00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:54,927","Before I met you,I had really little life."
6,24,133,"00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,403",And I couldn't imagine growing old--
6,24,134,"00:08:58,692 --> 00:08:59,761","Oh, my God."
6,24,135,"00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:02,367","-I know. But let me say it.-Oh, my God. Richard."
6,24,136,"00:09:02,772 --> 00:09:04,842",What? I'm Chandler.
6,24,137,"00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,525","Oh, that's Richard."
6,24,138,"00:09:10,412 --> 00:09:12,528",Maybe he won't see us.Richard!
6,24,139,"00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:18,608",Monica. Chandler.
6,24,140,"00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:22,970",I don't know why I did that.
6,24,141,"00:09:24,332 --> 00:09:27,449",-It's good to see you.-You too. You let your hair grow.
6,24,142,"00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:30,212","Oh, that's right,you always wanted me to."
6,24,143,"00:09:30,452 --> 00:09:32,044",I see your mustache is back.
6,24,144,"00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,363","Well, my nose got lonely."
6,24,145,"00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,526","And you don't have a mustache,which is good."
6,24,146,"00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,370",I'm Chandler.I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.
6,24,147,"00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:47,883","I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler.We used to date."
6,24,148,"00:09:48,132 --> 00:09:50,771",No one's supposed to know about us!
6,24,149,"00:09:53,572 --> 00:09:55,369","See, I did it again."
6,24,150,"00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:58,887","-Chandler, sit down.-I'll sit down."
6,24,151,"00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,121",Good to see you.
6,24,152,"00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:01,811","Your table is ready, sir."
6,24,153,"00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:03,565",Good to see you guys.
6,24,154,"00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:05,768","If you prefer, this table's available."
6,24,155,"00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:08,970",That might be fun.
6,24,156,"00:10:13,652 --> 00:10:15,244",What were you thinking?
6,24,157,"00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:17,124",I didn't know it was an auction.
6,24,158,"00:10:17,332 --> 00:10:18,811",I figured I'd take a guess.
6,24,159,"00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:21,771",Help a charity. Free boat!
6,24,160,"00:10:22,292 --> 00:10:24,806",Why would a charitygive away a free boat?
6,24,161,"00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:27,771",I don't know. Charity?
6,24,162,"00:10:28,812 --> 00:10:31,167","Well, just buy the damn boat."
6,24,163,"00:10:32,212 --> 00:10:34,772",Don't you thinkyou've had enough to drink?
6,24,164,"00:10:34,972 --> 00:10:37,042",I'm just helping the kids.
6,24,165,"00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:40,800",How is you drinking helping the kids?
6,24,166,"00:10:41,012 --> 00:10:44,800","Because the more I drink, the lessthere is for the kids to drink."
6,24,167,"00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:51,684",Mr. Tribbiani.Your contribution brings us. . .
6,24,168,"00:10:51,932 --> 00:10:54,162",. . .a big step closerto building the youth center.
6,24,169,"00:10:54,972 --> 00:10:57,486","Just out of curiosity,how much is that boat worth?"
6,24,170,"00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:59,489","I think it was valued at 1 9,000."
6,24,171,"00:10:59,972 --> 00:11:01,963","Hey, I was pretty close."
6,24,172,"00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:07,883","So, bad news."
6,24,173,"00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:11,169",I can't buy the boat.I don't have any money.
6,24,174,"00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:17,569","Joey! Joey, good one!"
6,24,175,"00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:20,646",Good! Very good!
6,24,176,"00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:29,281","-So I think I'm gonna take off now.-You can't leave, Joey!"
6,24,177,"00:11:29,532 --> 00:11:32,365",You agreed to buy that boat.It is a contract.
6,24,178,"00:11:32,612 --> 00:11:35,046","Plus, if you leave,my boss is gonna kill me."
6,24,179,"00:11:35,452 --> 00:11:37,966",I don't have that kind of money.
6,24,180,"00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:39,804","I know. Okay, okay, okay, okay."
6,24,181,"00:11:40,252 --> 00:11:41,367",This is what we'll do.
6,24,182,"00:11:41,612 --> 00:11:45,207","We'll go to the next highest bidder,and we'll let them buy it."
6,24,183,"00:11:45,452 --> 00:11:47,408",Then you're just gonnapay the difference.
6,24,184,"00:11:47,692 --> 00:11:48,681",Okay.
6,24,185,"00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:51,765",I don't know why the kids need ayouth center anyway.
6,24,186,"00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:56,363",They should just watch TV after schoollike I did. And I turned out fine.
6,24,187,"00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:58,287",Not great.
6,24,188,"00:12:00,932 --> 00:12:02,763",So we're hiding in the bathroom. . . .
6,24,189,"00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:06,248","Then I sneak out. But beforeMonica can, her parents come in."
6,24,190,"00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:08,363","I hid in the shower,next thing you know. . ."

6,24,193,"00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,485",I got a good one.
6,24,194,"00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,645",I once walked in on both my parentsmaking love to the same guy.
6,24,195,"00:12:23,932 --> 00:12:28,369",It's so great seeing you guys again.I'd like to make a toast.
6,24,196,"00:12:28,852 --> 00:12:31,889","As a poet once said, ""In the sweetnessof friendship. . ."

6,24,202,"00:12:53,492 --> 00:12:57,280",Have we got a story for you.Guess who we bumped into?
6,24,203,"00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:59,528",-Who?-Richard!
6,24,204,"00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:04,970",I thought you were going out.
6,24,205,"00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:08,801",I was. She was a little busywith a water balloon fight.
6,24,206,"00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:12,328",Sometimes grownups have commitmentsthey can't get out of.
6,24,207,"00:13:13,572 --> 00:13:15,403",Maybe she is too young for me.
6,24,208,"00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:19,966","When I was over there,I felt like I was a babysitter."
6,24,209,"00:13:20,212 --> 00:13:24,171",I finally see what you were talkingabout. I don't know what to do.
6,24,210,"00:13:24,372 --> 00:13:27,682",Just weigh the good stuff aboutthe relationship against the bad.
6,24,211,"00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,971",That's what I did when I first startedweighing stuff.
6,24,212,"00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:37,568","Okay, bad stuff.I'm 1 2 years older than she is."
6,24,213,"00:13:37,812 --> 00:13:39,564","If school finds out, you're fired."
6,24,214,"00:13:39,812 --> 00:13:42,565",-She's leaving for three months.-For camp.
6,24,215,"00:13:44,212 --> 00:13:45,361","Okay, good stuff."
6,24,216,"00:13:46,212 --> 00:13:49,045","Well, she's sweet and pretty and. . . ."
6,24,217,"00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,807","The only question you need to askis, do you see a future?"
6,24,218,"00:13:53,412 --> 00:13:56,006",Do you see yourself marrying her?
6,24,219,"00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:59,609","My God. You married her, didn't you?"

6,24,262,"00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:53,482","-Richard was there. I couldn't do it.-Oh, no."
6,24,263,"00:16:53,692 --> 00:16:57,731",I was gonna surprise her tomorrow.Now you've ruined it.
6,24,264,"00:16:57,972 --> 00:16:58,961",We didn't.
6,24,265,"00:16:59,172 --> 00:17:01,640",You walk in here andask to see her hand!

6,24,269,"00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:18,650",She only suspects something.So just throw her off the track.
6,24,270,"00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:22,128",I'll make her think marriageis the last thing on my mind.
6,24,271,"00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,892",Convince her you're scaredof commitment.
6,24,272,"00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:27,560",I can do that.I've had 30 years of practice.
6,24,273,"00:17:27,852 --> 00:17:30,571",Being you is finally gonna pay off!
6,24,274,"00:17:32,372 --> 00:17:33,691",Had to go to the basement. . .

6,24,282,"00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:12,169",Did ljust make a huge mistake?

6,24,295,"00:19:04,412 --> 00:19:06,403",How unnecessary it is.
6,24,296,"00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,285",How it's a way for governmentsto keep tabs on you.
6,24,297,"00:19:09,492 --> 00:19:11,164","Yeah, Big Brother."

6,25,102,"00:06:19,972 --> 00:06:22,532",One who is unlikely to take a wife.
6,25,103,"00:06:25,332 --> 00:06:28,449",Does he think I'll justwait around for nothing?
6,25,104,"00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:31,570",Face it.Chandler is against marriage.

6,25,127,"00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:46,650","No, like, ""What's that?"""
6,25,128,"00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:53,885","-Oh, you want me to be your backup.-Exactly."
6,25,129,"00:07:54,132 --> 00:07:56,123",Yeah. I already have one.

6,25,131,"00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:00,246",Phoebe?
6,25,132,"00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:03,731",But she just said Joey is her backup.
6,25,133,"00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:06,122","Oh, I don't think so."
6,25,134,"00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:10,521",I just spoke with her. She saidthat she and Joey made a deal.
6,25,135,"00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:13,570",That's impossible.We have had a deal for years.
6,25,136,"00:08:13,812 --> 00:08:15,165",We shook on it.
6,25,137,"00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:18,722","Although, believe me,she wanted to do a lot more than that."
6,25,138,"00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:24,126",Where have you been?
6,25,139,"00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:27,890",I was making a coconut phonewith the Professor.
6,25,140,"00:08:29,772 --> 00:08:32,605",Richard told Monicahe wants to marry her.
6,25,141,"00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:34,769",-What?-I've been looking for you.
6,25,142,"00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,331",Stop messing with her!
6,25,143,"00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:40,167",And I would have if these damnboat shoes wouldn't keep flying off!
6,25,144,"00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,848","-Oh, my God!-I know! They suck!"
6,25,145,"00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:46,770",He's not supposed to ask herto marry him! I am!
6,25,146,"00:08:47,012 --> 00:08:48,331",-I know!-What--?
6,25,147,"00:08:48,532 --> 00:08:52,127",You know what I'll do?I'll go over there and kick his ass!
6,25,148,"00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:53,925",Will you help me?
6,25,149,"00:08:55,732 --> 00:08:58,565","Look, us getting our asses kickedis not a solution."
6,25,150,"00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:04,003","-Look, just go and find Monica.-You're right."
6,25,151,"00:09:04,572 --> 00:09:06,369",I'm gonna get the ring. . .
6,25,152,"00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,965",. . .I'll go find her. . .

6,25,160,"00:09:45,172 --> 00:09:46,525",You want to come in?
6,25,161,"00:09:46,772 --> 00:09:48,125",I don't know.
6,25,162,"00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,530","Oh, okay."
6,25,163,"00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:54,330",I'll just leave the door openand go sit on the couch.
6,25,164,"00:09:56,812 --> 00:09:58,530",Chandler is such an idiot!
6,25,165,"00:09:58,772 --> 00:09:59,966",Drink?

6,25,171,"00:10:18,972 --> 00:10:20,928","No, that's okay."
6,25,172,"00:10:23,212 --> 00:10:24,725","So, Monica. . ."

6,25,176,"00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:34,925","Actually, I thought about youa couple months ago."
6,25,177,"00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:37,163","-Really?-Yeah, but it's because l. . ."
6,25,178,"00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:40,722",". . .had an eye exam,and I don't like my new eye doctor."

6,25,180,"00:10:43,692 --> 00:10:45,091","Yeah, he's no good."
6,25,181,"00:10:47,092 --> 00:10:50,129",Do you ever think about me in. . .

6,25,183,"00:10:52,692 --> 00:10:53,886",No.
6,25,184,"00:10:58,212 --> 00:11:01,921",Because getting over you wasthe hardest thing I've ever had to do.
6,25,185,"00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:04,682",I never let myself think about you.
6,25,186,"00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:14,811","Phoebe, you picked Joey and Ross?"
6,25,187,"00:11:15,052 --> 00:11:16,644",You can't have two backups!
6,25,188,"00:11:17,292 --> 00:11:18,850",Of course I can.
6,25,189,"00:11:19,092 --> 00:11:21,560",It's just good senseto back up your backup.
6,25,190,"00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:24,372","-Look, I've already lost Chandler.-What?"
6,25,191,"00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:26,440","Hey, Phoebe!"
6,25,192,"00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:27,920",We're both backups?
6,25,193,"00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:30,646",How could you do this to me?
6,25,194,"00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:35,325",What are you complaining about?You were both aware of the situation.
6,25,195,"00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,369","-I was not!-No, we weren't!"
6,25,196,"00:11:37,612 --> 00:11:41,082",This kind of back talkisn't gonna fly when we're married.
6,25,197,"00:11:41,932 --> 00:11:43,923",You can't have both. Pick one.
6,25,198,"00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:45,571","-Pick me!-No, pick me!"
6,25,199,"00:11:45,812 --> 00:11:48,326",I don't want to end up an old maid.

6,25,201,"00:11:51,012 --> 00:11:53,128",Ross is a good father.
6,25,202,"00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:54,566",But. . .
6,25,203,"00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:57,087",. . .Joey has a boat. This is hard.
6,25,204,"00:11:57,332 --> 00:11:59,448",This is crazy.I want to switch to Rachel.
6,25,205,"00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,966",I want to switch too.
6,25,206,"00:12:01,212 --> 00:12:03,089","No, wait!"
6,25,207,"00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:06,770","Wait, guys.Don't make any rash decisions."
6,25,208,"00:12:07,012 --> 00:12:08,923",Remember my promise:
6,25,209,"00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:12,010","If we get married,three times a week."
6,25,210,"00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:13,731","Oh, my God. Phoebe. . . ."
6,25,211,"00:12:13,972 --> 00:12:16,247",I'm talking about massages.

6,25,213,"00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:24,166",I know how to settle this.Here's what we'll do.
6,25,214,"00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,528","I'll write ""Joey"" . . ."
6,25,215,"00:12:26,732 --> 00:12:27,960",. . .on one napkin.
6,25,216,"00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:30,965","And I'm going to write ""Ross""on the other napkin. . ."
6,25,217,"00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:32,770",. . .and we'll pick one.
6,25,218,"00:12:33,012 --> 00:12:35,321",That person will be our backup.Here we go.
6,25,219,"00:12:35,532 --> 00:12:37,124",-That sounds fair.-All right.
6,25,220,"00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:38,851",Good. Switching them up.
6,25,221,"00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:44,730",-Pick one.-Left.

6,25,225,"00:12:59,772 --> 00:13:01,524",I miss this apartment.
6,25,226,"00:13:01,732 --> 00:13:03,962","Now, this is a grownup's apartment."
6,25,227,"00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:06,487","I should be with a grownup, you know?"
6,25,228,"00:13:06,892 --> 00:13:10,851",You're saying you need to bewith someone more mature.
6,25,229,"00:13:11,412 --> 00:13:12,606",Maybe someone with. . .
6,25,230,"00:13:13,972 --> 00:13:16,532",. . .a license to practice medicine.
6,25,231,"00:13:16,812 --> 00:13:18,450",Or a mustache.
6,25,232,"00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:22,326",Let's face it. I'm not a kid anymore.
6,25,233,"00:13:22,572 --> 00:13:25,325",I need to be with someonewho wants the same things.
6,25,234,"00:13:25,532 --> 00:13:29,730","Coming to my work and telling meyou love me, I want that!"
6,25,235,"00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:33,921","Talking about pig sex over lunch,I don't want that!"
6,25,236,"00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:36,725",I think that's fair.

6,25,238,"00:13:40,172 --> 00:13:42,925",Fair would've been youwanting to marry me then.
6,25,239,"00:13:43,172 --> 00:13:45,447",Or Chandler wanting to marry me now.

6,25,260,"00:15:05,012 --> 00:15:07,401",She said she had to think things over.
6,25,261,"00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:11,845","Oh, my God. I can't believe this.I thought you were a good guy."
6,25,262,"00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:13,764","Look, nothing happened."
6,25,263,"00:15:14,012 --> 00:15:17,721",Nothing happened? Nothing?You didn't tell her you love her?
6,25,264,"00:15:17,972 --> 00:15:20,532","Well, all right, one thing happened."
6,25,265,"00:15:21,012 --> 00:15:22,525",You know what you did?
6,25,266,"00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:24,927",My girlfriend is thinking things over.

6,25,268,"00:15:28,932 --> 00:15:30,524","Well, I'm sorry."
6,25,269,"00:15:31,812 --> 00:15:33,643",What's to think about? I love her.
6,25,270,"00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:37,771","Well, apparently I'm willingto offer her things that you are not."
6,25,271,"00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:41,209",I'm willing to offer her those things.This was just a plan.
6,25,272,"00:15:41,452 --> 00:15:45,809","To throw her off so when I offeredall these things, she'd be surprised."
6,25,273,"00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:49,844","If it helps, it worked very well."
6,25,274,"00:15:50,732 --> 00:15:53,724","It was working till you showed up,you big tree."
6,25,275,"00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:58,129",This isn't fair.

6,25,277,"00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,928",This is my chanceand I won't blow it. . .
6,25,278,"00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:06,327",. . .because we aremeant for each other.

7,1,129,"00:09:10,052 --> 00:09:12,088","Some, not a lot."
7,1,130,"00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:17,041",The reason I'm askingis because I had kind of a--
7,1,131,"00:09:17,612 --> 00:09:19,250",I was unable to--
7,1,132,"00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:22,649","I really wanted to, but I couldn't--"
7,1,133,"00:09:24,492 --> 00:09:26,323",There was an incident.
7,1,134,"00:09:27,972 --> 00:09:30,930","Don't worry about that, man.That happens."
7,1,135,"00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:34,523","-It's happened to you?-Yeah, once."

7,1,150,"00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:29,641",Can I ask you just a little question?Why tonight?
7,1,151,"00:10:30,932 --> 00:10:33,287",I waited my whole lifeto be engaged. . .
7,1,152,"00:10:33,652 --> 00:10:36,689",". . .and unlike some,I only plan on doing this once."
7,1,153,"00:10:38,612 --> 00:10:43,527","Maybe it's selfish, I'm sorry, but Ihoped tonight could just be about that."
7,1,154,"00:10:43,732 --> 00:10:45,450",But it is just about that.
7,1,155,"00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:47,961",Now it's about yougetting back together.
7,1,156,"00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:50,732","See, you kind of stole my thunder."

7,1,159,"00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:01,366",That's true.

7,1,163,"00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:12,605",Are you back together?Can I sing at your wedding?
7,1,164,"00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:15,729",Thunder being stolen.
7,1,165,"00:11:15,932 --> 00:11:19,368","-Phoebe, it's nothing.-Let's not make a big deal of this."
7,1,166,"00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,410",It was a one-time thing.It doesn't even matter.
7,1,167,"00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:23,926","Oh, my God."
7,1,168,"00:11:25,892 --> 00:11:28,565",I cannot believe you guysare talking about this.

7,1,171,"00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:42,884",I don't think that'swhat they were talking about.
7,1,172,"00:11:43,652 --> 00:11:46,689","What a great night.Chandler can't do it, they kissed."

7,1,174,"00:11:49,412 --> 00:11:50,447","No, it's not huge."
7,1,175,"00:11:50,692 --> 00:11:53,445",People thinking it's hugehas led Monica to believe. . .
7,1,176,"00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:55,808",". . .we're stealing her thunder,which we aren't."
7,1,177,"00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:57,845",We're still talking about it.
7,1,178,"00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,401","That, and Chandler's problem."
7,1,179,"00:12:01,892 --> 00:12:03,530","Monica, listen, listen."

7,1,191,"00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:45,329","You know, I think I don't feel likegoing to the Plaza."
7,1,192,"00:12:45,532 --> 00:12:47,204","Monica, this is ridiculous."
7,1,193,"00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:51,401",I don't want to talk about it.I don't. Especially with you.
7,1,194,"00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,771",That is whack.
7,1,195,"00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:10,245",I'll play it at the wedding.

7,1,200,"00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:25,089",Monica won't take this away.

7,1,208,"00:13:52,212 --> 00:13:55,045",Why not especially you and me?We were both kissing.
7,1,209,"00:13:55,412 --> 00:13:56,447",Still thinking about it?
7,1,210,"00:13:56,692 --> 00:14:00,002","I'm serious. What did she meanby that? ""Especially you. """

7,1,245,"00:16:21,612 --> 00:16:24,922","No, seriously, what wasthe ""especially me"" part about?"
7,1,246,"00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:28,647",Let's just say it's not the first timeyou've stolen my thunder.
7,1,247,"00:16:29,172 --> 00:16:30,844","Hey, here's a thought. . . ."
7,1,248,"00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,327","Monica, what are you talking about?"
7,1,249,"00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:37,569",My sweet 1 6. You went to third basewith my cousin Charlie.
7,1,250,"00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:39,649",Third base.
7,1,251,"00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:43,048",It was all everybody could talk about.
7,1,252,"00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:47,086",The only reason I did thatwas because your party was so boring.
7,1,253,"00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:49,606",We had a caricaturist.
7,1,254,"00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,968",Whenever I get marriedGuess who won 't be asked to sing
7,1,255,"00:16:56,212 --> 00:17:00,444",Somebody named GellerAnd somebody else named Bing

7,1,257,"00:17:07,732 --> 00:17:09,404",Yet here you are doing it again.
7,1,258,"00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,842",I don't wantto steal your stupid thunder.

7,1,260,"00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:16,650",Got me.
7,1,261,"00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:21,845","Easy, mimey, the moment has passed.It ain't gonna happen."
7,1,262,"00:17:23,532 --> 00:17:25,523",It'd be nice if I couldhave this night.
7,1,263,"00:17:25,732 --> 00:17:27,848",I never wanted any part of your night.
7,1,264,"00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:29,565",No one was supposed to see us.
7,1,265,"00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:33,321","Is that why you did it in the secrethallway, where nobody ever goes?"
7,1,266,"00:17:34,892 --> 00:17:36,610","Rachel, I've been thinking."
7,1,267,"00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:40,964",I don't think us getting togethertonight is such a good idea.
7,1,268,"00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,248",I'm calling it off.
7,1,269,"00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:46,842","Way to save your dignity, my man."
7,1,270,"00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:52,603","Mon, why, why would I ever wantto take away from your night?"
7,1,271,"00:17:52,812 --> 00:17:55,280","I don't know, maybe you feela little resentful."
7,1,272,"00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,046",Maybe you thoughtyou'd get married first.
7,1,273,"00:17:58,292 --> 00:17:59,441",Maybe you can't stand. . .
7,1,274,"00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:02,729",. . .that your formerly fat friendis getting married first.

7,1,276,"00:18:07,332 --> 00:18:09,288",Now I want to steal your thunder.
7,1,277,"00:18:09,532 --> 00:18:12,046","Come on, Ross. Let's go have sex!"
7,1,278,"00:18:21,412 --> 00:18:24,643",I can't believe you're gonna have sexon my engagement night.
7,1,279,"00:18:24,852 --> 00:18:26,490","Well, somebody should."
7,1,280,"00:18:29,532 --> 00:18:31,363","Look, if we're gonna do this--"
7,1,281,"00:18:31,572 --> 00:18:34,040",We're not.She's just gonna think we are.
7,1,282,"00:18:34,252 --> 00:18:36,368","I see, so everybody wins."
7,1,283,"00:18:38,932 --> 00:18:40,684","-Who is it?-It's Monica, open up."

7,3,170,"00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:04,891",I'm sure Dad doesn't care.
7,3,171,"00:10:05,133 --> 00:10:06,566",He probably thought it was funny.
7,3,172,"00:10:06,813 --> 00:10:08,485",He'll be telling this story for years.
7,3,173,"00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:11,366",I don't want him to tellthis story for years.
7,3,174,"00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,848","Oh, but he will."
7,3,175,"00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:18,566",He still tells the story about howMonica tried to escape from fat camp.
7,3,176,"00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,402",I wasn't escaping.
7,3,177,"00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:23,763",Then how'd you get caughtin the barbed wire?
7,3,178,"00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:26,531",I was trying to help out a squirrel.
7,3,179,"00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,451",You were trying to eat it.
7,3,180,"00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,372",If that is your father callingto tell this story. . .
7,3,181,"00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:36,245",. . .then the marriage is off!
7,3,182,"00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,724",Come on. Hello.
7,3,183,"00:10:39,413 --> 00:10:41,643","I'm sorry, you have the wrong number."
7,3,184,"00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:43,724","I'll call you later, Dad.I love you."
7,3,185,"00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:51,652",I'm off to see your dad.
7,3,186,"00:10:52,453 --> 00:10:53,806",Aren't you a little overdressed?
7,3,187,"00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:59,049",You better make surehe tips you this time.
7,3,188,"00:11:00,093 --> 00:11:03,244",I figured I would try to convincehim not to tell the story anymore. . .
7,3,189,"00:11:03,493 --> 00:11:06,246",. . .and I figured the best wayto do that was face to face.
7,3,190,"00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:08,882","And by ""face,"" I don't mean his lap."
7,3,191,"00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,852","And by ""face,"" I don't mean my ass."
7,3,192,"00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:17,206",Are you getting Monica andChandler a present?
7,3,193,"00:11:17,413 --> 00:11:19,688","I don't know. You know,they didn't get us anything."
7,3,194,"00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:21,451",Thank you!
7,3,195,"00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:24,448",Hey.
7,3,196,"00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,127","Well, hello."
7,3,197,"00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:29,086","So when are we gettingback out on the water, matey?"
7,3,198,"00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:33,330","I don't know the boat wayto say this, but, never."
7,3,199,"00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:36,162",Why not?
7,3,200,"00:11:36,373 --> 00:11:38,648",Because you're mean on the boat.
7,3,201,"00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:41,005",I was just trying to teach you.
7,3,202,"00:11:41,213 --> 00:11:43,522","Well, lesson learned.Rachel is mean."
7,3,203,"00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:47,445","Yep, yep, yep."
7,3,204,"00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:50,569",I remember when she took me outon her dad's boat.
7,3,205,"00:11:50,813 --> 00:11:52,610",She wouldn't let me help at all.
7,3,206,"00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,690","Excuse me, I wanted you to help."
7,3,207,"00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:56,048",But you couldn't move. . .
7,3,208,"00:11:56,293 --> 00:11:59,126",. . .because you were wearingthree life jackets.
7,3,209,"00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:03,052",You have to respect the sea.
7,3,210,"00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,093","Joey, I'm sorry if you thoughtthat was mean."
7,3,211,"00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,289","But I tell you, that was not mean."
7,3,212,"00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:13,242",My father is mean. He used to alwaysyell at me on the boat.
7,3,213,"00:12:13,493 --> 00:12:16,451",It was horrible.I was being a really good teacher.
7,3,214,"00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,406","Does a good teacher say,""Put down the beer, pinhead! """
7,3,215,"00:12:20,133 --> 00:12:23,489",Does a good student drink 7 beersduring his first lesson?
7,3,216,"00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:25,162",Six and a half.
7,3,217,"00:12:25,693 --> 00:12:27,570","You knocked the lastone out of my hand, remember?"
7,3,218,"00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,604",I didn't want you to get hitby the boom.
7,3,219,"00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:31,087","Well, it hit me anyway."
7,3,220,"00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,370",It would have hurt a lot lessif I had finished that last beer.
7,3,221,"00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:40,248",I'm sorry. I will try to tone it downand stop yelling.
7,3,222,"00:12:40,933 --> 00:12:42,252",No bossing me around?
7,3,223,"00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:44,165",-I won't boss you around.-And be nice?
7,3,224,"00:12:44,373 --> 00:12:45,965",-I'll be nice.-You'll be topless?
7,3,225,"00:12:47,013 --> 00:12:49,402",-Joey!-You want me to learn?
7,3,226,"00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:58,442",Here's batch 22.Maybe these are like your grandma's.
7,3,227,"00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:01,446","This has a bit of orange peel,but no nutmeg."
7,3,228,"00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:03,251",Let's give it a shot.
7,3,229,"00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:06,082",I haven't made so many cookiessince 9th grade.
7,3,230,"00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,806","What for, a bake sale?"
7,3,231,"00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:09,844","No, just a Friday night."
7,3,232,"00:13:15,293 --> 00:13:16,521",These are pretty good.
7,3,233,"00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,564","Yeah, but not as good as batch 1 7."
7,3,234,"00:13:18,773 --> 00:13:19,762",Which one was that?
7,3,235,"00:13:19,973 --> 00:13:22,009",The ones we had afteryou almost threw up.
7,3,236,"00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:25,049","Oh, yeah, batch 1 7 was good."
7,3,237,"00:13:25,293 --> 00:13:28,251",I did not like batch 1 6.
7,3,238,"00:13:29,693 --> 00:13:31,251",I'm okay.
7,3,239,"00:13:32,373 --> 00:13:35,524",Any more from the good batch?We could work off those.
7,3,240,"00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:39,043",I think there's one left.
7,3,241,"00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:46,649","Batch 1 6.Sixteen, people, get out of the way!"
7,3,242,"00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:57,442","Okay, Joey. You're doing really good."
7,3,243,"00:13:57,653 --> 00:13:59,723",I just need youto step to the portside.
7,3,244,"00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:07,242",Remember talking about the portside?
7,3,245,"00:14:07,453 --> 00:14:08,932","Oh, yeah."
7,3,246,"00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,248",No.
7,3,247,"00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:15,408","It's left, sweetie, but that's okay.That's a tough one."
7,3,248,"00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:16,966",Why not just say left?
7,3,249,"00:14:17,173 --> 00:14:18,845","Okay, go to the left."
7,3,250,"00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,932",The left.
7,3,251,"00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,122",Just sit over there!
7,3,252,"00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,403",You're yelling again. See that?
7,3,253,"00:14:28,613 --> 00:14:32,401","Oh, no, no. Very quiet.Said with love, no yelling."
7,3,254,"00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:35,569",You know what?
7,3,255,"00:14:35,813 --> 00:14:39,249","Since I'm here, I'm gonna havea beer on the portside."
7,3,256,"00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:42,125",See what I did there?
7,3,257,"00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:48,611",We're luffing a little.Can you tighten up the Cunningham?
7,3,258,"00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:52,728",You just said a bunchof stuff I don't know.
7,3,259,"00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,527","Joey, come on!We just went over this."
7,3,260,"00:14:55,773 --> 00:14:57,604",We did that when that bird. . .
7,3,261,"00:14:57,853 --> 00:14:59,809",. . .flew over with the fishin his mouth.
7,3,262,"00:15:00,053 --> 00:15:01,645",Did you see it? It was gross.
7,3,263,"00:15:01,853 --> 00:15:03,844",I did not see the bird or the fish!
7,3,264,"00:15:04,093 --> 00:15:07,005",I did not see the piece ofStyrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!
7,3,265,"00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:12,249","I did not, because I was tryingto teach you how to sail a boat."
7,3,266,"00:15:12,493 --> 00:15:15,166",Which obviously isan impossible thing to do.
7,3,267,"00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,331","You're yelling, and I don'tsee you taking your top off."
7,3,268,"00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:20,006",I quit!
7,3,269,"00:15:20,893 --> 00:15:23,885",-What do you mean? You can't quit.-Why not?
7,3,270,"00:15:24,093 --> 00:15:26,891",You're not finished! I won't have it.Greenes do not quit.
7,3,271,"00:15:27,813 --> 00:15:29,405",Greenes?
7,3,272,"00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:32,605",I'm a Tribbiani. Tribbianis quit.
7,3,273,"00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:36,922","Oh, my God."
7,3,274,"00:15:37,173 --> 00:15:40,006","I just said, ""Greenes don't quit,""didn't l?"
7,3,275,"00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,441","Did I say, ""Greenes don't quit""?"
7,3,276,"00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:44,565",Yes! And you're still yelling at me.
7,3,277,"00:15:44,773 --> 00:15:47,606","No, I'm not yelling at you.I'm just yelling near you."
7,3,278,"00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,610","Oh, God, Joey. I'm my father."
7,3,279,"00:15:49,853 --> 00:15:52,413","Oh, my God. This is horrible."
7,3,280,"00:15:53,493 --> 00:15:57,202","I try so hard not to be my mother,I didn't see this coming."
7,3,281,"00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:04,611",I'm so sorry.I just wanted you to learn.
7,3,282,"00:16:09,293 --> 00:16:10,612",I did learn.
7,3,283,"00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:14,089","-Really?-Yeah, come on."
7,3,284,"00:16:14,293 --> 00:16:15,772",It's okay.
7,3,285,"00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:17,804",I know what a mainsail is.
7,3,286,"00:16:18,453 --> 00:16:22,207",I know to duck whenthe boom comes across.

7,3,289,"00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:32,288",It would make my grandmother happy. . .

7,3,291,"00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:39,811",I bet she's looking up at usand smiling right now.
7,3,292,"00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,085",Looking up?
7,3,293,"00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:47,730",She was really nice to me butshe's in hell for sure.
7,3,294,"00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:50,562","Well, I've tried everything."
7,3,295,"00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,451",I give up.I'm not gonna be the mom. . .

7,6,138,"00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:18,650","No. No, we don't."
7,6,139,"00:08:19,093 --> 00:08:20,003","Yes, we do."
7,6,140,"00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:23,644","Now, look.That was the best nap I ever had."
7,6,141,"00:08:28,213 --> 00:08:30,852",I don't know whatyou're talking about.
7,6,142,"00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:32,972","Come on, admit it."
7,6,143,"00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:35,164",That was the best nap you ever had.
7,6,144,"00:08:36,293 --> 00:08:37,851",I've had better.
7,6,145,"00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,251",Okay. When?
7,6,146,"00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:45,726",All right! All right!It was the best nap ever!
7,6,147,"00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:47,372","I said it, okay?"
7,6,148,"00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:49,450","But it's over, Joey!"
7,6,149,"00:08:51,453 --> 00:08:52,886",I want to do it again.
7,6,150,"00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:58,684",We can't do it again.
7,6,151,"00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,248",-Why not?-Because it's weird!
7,6,152,"00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,052",Fine.
7,6,153,"00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:06,322",You want a drink?
7,6,154,"00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:09,923",-Sure. What do you got?-Warm milk and Excedrin PM.
7,6,155,"00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:18,246",Chandler.
7,6,156,"00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:21,283",I just figured out who you are.
7,6,157,"00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:23,643",Can you figure out what I'm doing?
7,6,158,"00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:27,527",-You're Louis Posen.-Who?
7,6,159,"00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:30,847",He was my best friend in fifth grade.
7,6,160,"00:09:31,053 --> 00:09:34,284","One day, I asked him to bemy boyfriend and he said no."
7,6,161,"00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,648",Do you know why?
7,6,162,"00:09:35,853 --> 00:09:39,926",Because you kept talking to him whilehe was trying to go to the bathroom?
7,6,163,"00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:43,530","No, but because he thoughtI was too fa--"
7,6,164,"00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:48,764","Every time I think about it,I feel as bad as I did then."
7,6,165,"00:09:48,973 --> 00:09:51,441",I really think you shouldapologize to Julie.
7,6,166,"00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:54,651","Honey, are you kidding?That was like 1 6 years ago."
7,6,167,"00:09:54,853 --> 00:09:58,482",It would make me feel betterif Louis apologized to me.
7,6,168,"00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:02,129","I'll do it. But I warn you,this may make me a better person."
7,6,169,"00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,927",And that is not the manyou fell in love with.
7,6,170,"00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:10,687","Okay, we'll give you hypotheticalmaid-of-honor situations."
7,6,171,"00:10:10,893 --> 00:10:13,202",You'll be scoredon a scale of one to ten.
7,6,172,"00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:15,722",-One being the highest.-Ten is the highest.
7,6,173,"00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:19,084",-Why is 1 0 the highest?-Because it's the highest.
7,6,174,"00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,085","Okay, Rachel, you're up first."
7,6,175,"00:10:24,293 --> 00:10:26,932",Situation number one:You're with Monica.
7,6,176,"00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:31,126",The wedding is about to startwhen Monica gets cold feet. Go!
7,6,177,"00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:33,489",I don't want to marry Chandler.

7,6,179,"00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,362",One man the rest of my life?I don't know.
7,6,180,"00:10:38,573 --> 00:10:41,007",This means I'll neverget to sleep with Joey.
7,6,181,"00:10:43,373 --> 00:10:45,329","Look, Monica. . ."
7,6,182,"00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:47,564",. . .getting cold feet is very common.
7,6,183,"00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:50,082",It's just becauseof all the anticipation.
7,6,184,"00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,292",And you just have to rememberthat you love Chandler.
7,6,185,"00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,927","And also, I ran out on a wedding."
7,6,186,"00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:59,482",You don't get to keep the gifts.
7,6,187,"00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:02,483",Drawing on your own experience.
7,6,188,"00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:03,887",Very good.

7,6,201,"00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,730","Yes, excellent. Perfect score."
7,6,202,"00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:39,204",She just made a scenein the middle of the ceremony!
7,6,203,"00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:42,092","Hey, you wanta little taste of Pheebs?"
7,6,204,"00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:47,330",It is time for you to giveyour maid-of-honor speech.
7,6,205,"00:11:47,533 --> 00:11:48,966",We haven't even prepared--
7,6,206,"00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:51,403","-Go!-Okay, okay, okay."
7,6,207,"00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:54,922",Webster's Dictionarydefines marriage as--

7,6,209,"00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:04,408",I met-- I met Monica when we werejust a couple of 6-year-olds. . .
7,6,210,"00:12:04,613 --> 00:12:09,323",. . .and became friends with Chandlerwhen he was 25. . .
7,6,211,"00:12:09,573 --> 00:12:11,803",. . .although he seemedlike a 6-year-old.
7,6,212,"00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:13,971",Oh.
7,6,213,"00:12:14,653 --> 00:12:16,803",Thank you. Thank you very much.
7,6,214,"00:12:18,653 --> 00:12:21,247",I've known themseparately and together.
7,6,215,"00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:26,408",To know them as a couple is to knowthat you are in the presence of love.
7,6,216,"00:12:26,693 --> 00:12:29,810",So I would like to raise my glass. . .
7,6,217,"00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:31,605",. . .to Monica and Chandler. . .
7,6,218,"00:12:31,813 --> 00:12:36,125",. . .and the beautiful adventure theyare about to embark upon together.
7,6,219,"00:12:36,373 --> 00:12:39,843",I can think of no two peoplebetter prepared for the journey.
7,6,220,"00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,172",Wow.
7,6,221,"00:12:43,453 --> 00:12:45,603","-Great speech.-Yeah, it really was."

7,6,225,"00:12:58,293 --> 00:13:01,603",I can't believe that Monicaand Chandler are getting married.
7,6,226,"00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:04,281",I remember talkingabout this day with Rachel. . .
7,6,227,"00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:07,212",". . .while we wereshowering together, naked."

7,6,232,"00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:36,403",It's a nickname. I'll explain later.
7,6,233,"00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:38,406",It's pretty clear.
7,6,234,"00:13:40,973 --> 00:13:44,443","I owe you a long, overdue apology."
7,6,235,"00:13:44,653 --> 00:13:47,963",I shouldn't have broken up with youbecause of your weight.
7,6,236,"00:13:48,773 --> 00:13:50,604",That's why you broke up with me?
7,6,237,"00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,804",You didn't know that?
7,6,238,"00:13:57,693 --> 00:13:59,923","Well, I guess my work here is done."
7,6,239,"00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:09,123","First of all, I would like to sayyou both performed very well, okay?"
7,6,240,"00:14:09,373 --> 00:14:10,852",You should be proud.
7,6,241,"00:14:11,093 --> 00:14:15,644","And I'd also like to say, in thiscompetition, there are no losers."
7,6,242,"00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:18,088","Well, except Rachel. Damn it!"
7,6,243,"00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:21,171",Really? I won.
7,6,244,"00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:24,206","-What?-I'm sorry, Rach, it was really close."
7,6,245,"00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,962","-Well, then I demand a recount!-Actually, it wasn't that close."
7,6,246,"00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:31,131",You know what?Your thing was so stupid anyway.
7,6,247,"00:14:31,373 --> 00:14:33,489","We're gonna flip a coin, all right?"
7,6,248,"00:14:34,013 --> 00:14:35,241",Heads.
7,6,249,"00:14:37,173 --> 00:14:39,607",What? The coins havefinally forgiven me!

7,6,253,"00:14:56,373 --> 00:14:59,922","Boy, I tell you. That judging stufftook a lot out of me."
7,6,254,"00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,248",-Yeah?-Yeah.
7,6,255,"00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:05,526",Thinking about maybe going upstairsand taking a little nap on my couch.
7,6,256,"00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:10,922",Why would I care about that?
7,6,257,"00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:15,125",No reason. I'm just saying that. . .
7,6,258,"00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:17,526",. . .that's where I'll be.
7,6,259,"00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:40,207","As bad as that went,I actually enjoyed myself."
7,6,260,"00:15:40,413 --> 00:15:44,565",I think that I'm going to apologizefor all the stupid things that I do.
7,6,261,"00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:47,247",Why don't you just stopdoing stupid things?
7,6,262,"00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:51,406",-Then you wouldn't have to apologize.-I'd love it if I could do both.
7,6,263,"00:15:54,213 --> 00:15:57,125","All right, I have to ask."
7,6,264,"00:15:57,573 --> 00:15:58,562",What?
7,6,265,"00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:02,008",Will you break up with meif I get fat?
7,6,266,"00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,328",What?
7,6,267,"00:16:03,533 --> 00:16:06,684",You broke up with Julie.How much weight did she gain?
7,6,268,"00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:09,123",A hundred and forty-five pounds.
7,6,269,"00:16:10,493 --> 00:16:11,721",In one year?
7,6,270,"00:16:11,973 --> 00:16:14,089","My God, what did she eat?Her family?"
7,6,271,"00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:18,051",That's not the point.
7,6,272,"00:16:18,253 --> 00:16:22,041","I know it was a stupid reason tobreak up with someone, but I was 1 5."
7,6,273,"00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:26,292","Yeah, well, that's notthe only time this was an issue."
7,6,274,"00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:30,611",You remember when you spentThanksgiving with us?
7,6,275,"00:16:30,813 --> 00:16:31,882",You called me fat.
7,6,276,"00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,202",Wait a minute.
7,6,277,"00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:35,927",-That was totally different.-How?
7,6,278,"00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:39,762",You were not supposed to hear that.I said that behind your back.
7,6,279,"00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:44,364","What if I have babies, okay?I'm gonna look different."
7,6,280,"00:16:44,573 --> 00:16:47,007","I'm okay with that,but I'm not sure you are."
7,6,281,"00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:51,001","You have to realize I don't thinkof you as a thin, beautiful woman."
7,6,282,"00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:58,243",This is one of the things thatI can apologize for later.
7,6,283,"00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,163","What I mean is, you're Monica."
7,6,284,"00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:05,331",Okay? And I am in love with Monica.
7,6,285,"00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,082",Keep going.
7,6,286,"00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:11,172",So you can balloon upor you can shrink down. . .
7,6,287,"00:17:11,413 --> 00:17:13,290",. . .and I will still love you.
7,6,288,"00:17:14,813 --> 00:17:17,930",Even if I were to shrink downto 2 inches tall?
7,6,289,"00:17:18,893 --> 00:17:20,849",I'd carry you around in my pocket.
7,6,290,"00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:23,282",I love you.
7,6,291,"00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:29,326",Skidmark still got a waywith the ladies.
7,6,292,"00:17:32,213 --> 00:17:33,202","Hi, Pheebs."
7,6,293,"00:17:33,413 --> 00:17:34,766",-Hi.-Hi.
7,6,294,"00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,571",I just want to apologize.
7,6,295,"00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:39,088",I'm really sorry I was a baby.
7,6,296,"00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:42,683","That's ridiculous.Rachel, we were all babies once."
7,6,297,"00:17:45,213 --> 00:17:47,249","Oh, you mean today. Yeah."

7,7,126,"00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:38,448",I'm sorry?
7,7,127,"00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:43,124",My doctoral dissertation is in thelibrary at school. I went to see it.
7,7,128,"00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:48,367",And there were students making babiesright in the paleontology section.
7,7,129,"00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:52,284","Oh, my God.Did you get to see anything good?"
7,7,130,"00:07:53,412 --> 00:07:54,606",At your school. . .
7,7,131,"00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:59,727",. . .was there a place on campuswhere students went to fool around?
7,7,132,"00:08:00,052 --> 00:08:01,121","Yeah, there was."
7,7,133,"00:08:01,372 --> 00:08:05,650",In the corner of the library where allthe books were that nobody ever read.
7,7,134,"00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:07,883","Yes, there was."
7,7,135,"00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:12,086","Great, because people kept showing up.I think it's like a thing."
7,7,136,"00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,931",Hold on a second.
7,7,137,"00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:17,005","Fifth floor, against that back wall?"
7,7,138,"00:08:19,092 --> 00:08:20,889","Oh, for crying out loud!"
7,7,139,"00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:26,401",-So we should go catch our movie.-What's the rush?
7,7,140,"00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:29,212",I'd like to see the previews.
7,7,141,"00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,605",The candy.
7,7,142,"00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:36,123","-Oh, hey.-Well, look who's here."

7,7,145,"00:08:39,412 --> 00:08:41,926",We were about to take offand see a movie.
7,7,146,"00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:45,564","-Oh, no!-What's wrong?"
7,7,147,"00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:49,811","Phoebe, we forgot that partywe have to go to."
7,7,148,"00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,809","Oh, no."
7,7,149,"00:08:52,772 --> 00:08:53,761",What party?
7,7,150,"00:08:54,052 --> 00:08:55,804",A birthday party.
7,7,151,"00:08:56,892 --> 00:08:58,245",Whose birthday party?
7,7,152,"00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:00,608",Alison's birthday party.
7,7,153,"00:09:03,052 --> 00:09:04,280",And how old is Alison?
7,7,154,"00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:05,851",Thirty-two.
7,7,155,"00:09:08,612 --> 00:09:12,400",Wait a minute.Why don't you guys do something?
7,7,156,"00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:15,001",Look how that worked out.
7,7,157,"00:09:19,452 --> 00:09:22,250","Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here."
7,7,158,"00:09:22,492 --> 00:09:27,088","Do you know the paleontology section,fifth floor, stack 437?"
7,7,159,"00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:30,045","Well, yes.Just give me five minutes."
7,7,160,"00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:33,204",I just have to find someoneto cover my shift.
7,7,161,"00:09:35,612 --> 00:09:38,445","No, no, no."
7,7,162,"00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:40,603",Can I speak to someone in charge?
7,7,163,"00:09:44,372 --> 00:09:45,202",How can I help?
7,7,164,"00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:48,722","Hi, I was wondering, is it possibleto increase security. . ."
7,7,165,"00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,803",. . .in the paleontology section?
7,7,166,"00:09:51,012 --> 00:09:52,650",I wrote a book that's up there.
7,7,167,"00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,122","And instead of reading it,people are. . . ."
7,7,168,"00:09:55,372 --> 00:09:58,364","Well, they're rolling aroundin front of it."
7,7,169,"00:09:59,412 --> 00:10:02,609",We are aware of the problemyou're referring to.
7,7,170,"00:10:07,172 --> 00:10:10,721","As far as increasing security,I'm afraid the library's understaffed."
7,7,171,"00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:13,281",I can't help you.
7,7,172,"00:10:13,772 --> 00:10:15,046","Well, fine."
7,7,173,"00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:18,011",If I'm the only personwith any appreciation. . .
7,7,174,"00:10:18,212 --> 00:10:21,887",". . .of the sanctity of the writtenword, then I'll go defend it myself."
7,7,175,"00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,403",Don't you follow me.
7,7,176,"00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:31,930",-How did it go with Erin?-Unbelievable.
7,7,177,"00:10:32,172 --> 00:10:34,049",We had the best time.
7,7,178,"00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:38,647","-So you're not mad anymore?-No, no. You guys were totally right."
7,7,179,"00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:41,002",This was much better thanthe first date.
7,7,180,"00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:43,646",It was awkward.We were both nervous.
7,7,181,"00:10:43,892 --> 00:10:46,804","-Didn't you sleep together?-Yeah, that calms me down."
7,7,182,"00:10:48,852 --> 00:10:50,649",And we have so much in common.
7,7,183,"00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:55,807","She loves sandwiches, sports.Although she is a Met fan."
7,7,184,"00:10:56,252 --> 00:10:58,846","Not an issue now,but if we had kids. . . ."
7,7,185,"00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:02,801","Oh, my God! Listen to you talkingabout having kids."
7,7,186,"00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:06,211","Oh, my Joey."
7,7,187,"00:11:06,452 --> 00:11:08,602",Please don't get married before I do.
7,7,188,"00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:18,167",I just cannot believethat Clark stood me up.
7,7,189,"00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:19,806",He may still show up.
7,7,190,"00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,206","What are you, stupid?"
7,7,191,"00:11:22,492 --> 00:11:25,802",-It's been three hours.-Is that all?
7,7,192,"00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:30,202",Let's go on to happier things.
7,7,193,"00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:32,846",Why don't you tell meabout your lovely wedding.
7,7,194,"00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:37,648",There was something that we wantedto tell you about the wedding.
7,7,195,"00:11:37,892 --> 00:11:41,009",It's going to be a small ceremony.
7,7,196,"00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:42,810",Tiny.
7,7,197,"00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:46,605",We're not even surewhy we're having it.
7,7,198,"00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:50,329",It's actually going to be just family.
7,7,199,"00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:54,802","Oh, wait."
7,7,200,"00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:58,520",You two think of me as family?
7,7,201,"00:12:02,092 --> 00:12:05,209","I have to ask you something now,and be honest."
7,7,202,"00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:09,849","Do you want me to sing""Careless Whisper"" or ""Lady in Red""?"
7,7,203,"00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:15,242",How can you say that?The Mets have no closer.
7,7,204,"00:12:15,492 --> 00:12:18,609",-What about Benitez?-What about game one of the series?
7,7,205,"00:12:18,852 --> 00:12:21,207",-What about shut up?-You shut up.
7,7,206,"00:12:22,012 --> 00:12:24,048",I love arguing with her.
7,7,207,"00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:26,010",-Be right back.-Okay.
7,7,208,"00:12:27,692 --> 00:12:28,920",How's it going with Joey?
7,7,209,"00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:31,009","Oh, okay."
7,7,210,"00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:32,571",Okay?
7,7,211,"00:12:32,772 --> 00:12:36,606","Tell me that you like him, please.I mean, tell me that you like him."
7,7,212,"00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:41,005","He's a really great guy, and I knowyou really want this to work out. . ."
7,7,213,"00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:44,045",. . .but I just don't see thishaving a future.
7,7,214,"00:12:46,492 --> 00:12:49,245",But you said that you liked him.What happened?
7,7,215,"00:12:49,492 --> 00:12:52,131",Did you just change your mind?
7,7,216,"00:12:52,612 --> 00:12:55,206",-Kind of.-Then change it back!
7,7,217,"00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:59,841","I'm sorry.It's just, there's no real spark."
7,7,218,"00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:01,804",Didn't you sleep together?
7,7,219,"00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:03,361",Yeah.
7,7,220,"00:13:03,612 --> 00:13:05,204",Tramp.
7,7,221,"00:13:06,972 --> 00:13:08,451",Does Joey have any idea?
7,7,222,"00:13:08,692 --> 00:13:10,922",I don't think he does.You know what?
7,7,223,"00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:13,811",Maybe you could tell himI'm not interested. . .
7,7,224,"00:13:14,052 --> 00:13:15,883",. . .in a serious relationship.
7,7,225,"00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,402","You mean, like,that you're kind of a loner?"
7,7,226,"00:13:19,612 --> 00:13:20,965","Yeah, that'd be great."
7,7,227,"00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,852",And maybe that you're a real stronzo.
7,7,228,"00:13:24,052 --> 00:13:24,848",I'm sorry.
7,7,229,"00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:28,601",I guess ltalian isn't oneof the four languages you speak.
7,7,230,"00:13:30,892 --> 00:13:33,406","-Hey. Want to go?-Yeah, let's go."
7,7,231,"00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:36,610","-Okay. See you guys later.-Bye, guys."
7,7,232,"00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:39,568","Hey, thank you so much."
7,7,233,"00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:44,081",Wow.
7,7,234,"00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:47,005",I guess it wasn't cupidthat brought her here.
7,7,235,"00:13:47,252 --> 00:13:50,642","No, just a regular old flying dwarf."
7,7,236,"00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,852","Yes, yes. How can I help you?"
7,7,237,"00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:01,810",We were just looking around.
7,7,238,"00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:04,207","Oh, you're fellow scholars."
7,7,239,"00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:06,807",What exactly were you looking for?
7,7,240,"00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,009",Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock'smusings. . .
7,7,241,"00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:13,601",. . .on the Smilodon californicus?
7,7,242,"00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:17,561",Get out of here!
7,7,243,"00:14:26,852 --> 00:14:28,331",Meeting someone?
7,7,244,"00:14:28,532 --> 00:14:31,126",Or are you just here to brush up. . .
7,7,245,"00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:34,170",. . .on Merriam's views on evolution?
7,7,246,"00:14:34,452 --> 00:14:38,843","Actually, I find Merriam's viewsfar too progressionist."
7,7,247,"00:14:43,292 --> 00:14:46,443",I find Merriam's viewsfar too progressionist.
7,7,248,"00:14:46,692 --> 00:14:49,729",I'm sorry. Who are you?
7,7,249,"00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,048",I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.
7,7,250,"00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,807",Ross Geller? Why do I know that name?It's a. . . .
7,7,251,"00:14:56,172 --> 00:14:57,161",Wait.
7,7,252,"00:15:01,012 --> 00:15:02,240",Did you write this?
7,7,253,"00:15:03,092 --> 00:15:04,525",Yes.
7,7,254,"00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:11,326",You're the personwho checked out my book?
7,7,255,"00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,803","You know, you look nothinglike I would have thought."
7,7,256,"00:15:17,412 --> 00:15:18,845",You're so young.
7,7,257,"00:15:19,972 --> 00:15:23,601","Well, I skipped fourth grade."
7,7,258,"00:15:31,172 --> 00:15:35,006","I am very, very sorry."
7,7,259,"00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:47,440",-So how was your date?-Great. We walked around the Village.
7,7,260,"00:15:47,692 --> 00:15:50,206",We went to this ice cream place.Split a milk shake.
7,7,261,"00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:52,044","Seventy-thirty, but still."
7,7,262,"00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:56,687",I'm thinking of taking her upstateto one of those bed and breakfasts.
7,7,263,"00:15:56,892 --> 00:15:59,087",Really? She said she wants to go?
7,7,264,"00:15:59,332 --> 00:16:03,769","No, it's a surprise. It's gonna betricky, because she's busy at work."
7,7,265,"00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:08,889","Joey, look, honey,we need to talk, okay?"
7,7,266,"00:16:11,212 --> 00:16:13,123",I got the feeling from her. . .
7,7,267,"00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,604",. . .that she's not lookingfor a serious relationship.
7,7,268,"00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:21,160",-Where are you getting this?-She told me.
7,7,269,"00:16:23,052 --> 00:16:25,202",She said she's kind of a loner.
7,7,270,"00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:35,607","-Joey---Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know."
7,7,271,"00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:38,406","I'm a loner too, right?"
7,7,272,"00:16:39,492 --> 00:16:42,689","Hey, Joey. You know what?You are way too good for her."
7,7,273,"00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:47,602","I promise, next time I will tell themyou're not looking for a relationship."
7,7,274,"00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:53,209","No, don't do that. Just. . . ."
7,7,275,"00:16:55,012 --> 00:16:58,004","-Next time, make sure she likes me.-Well, that too."
7,7,276,"00:17:02,972 --> 00:17:04,200",Joey?
7,7,277,"00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:09,403",-Do you want some pancakes?-Finally.
7,7,278,"00:17:13,252 --> 00:17:14,765",What are we gonna do?
7,7,279,"00:17:15,252 --> 00:17:16,924","I say we go with ""Careless Whisper. """
7,7,280,"00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:21,881",Chandler?
7,7,281,"00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:24,607",Did she see us yet? Did she see us?
7,7,282,"00:17:29,292 --> 00:17:31,203","Janice, what are you doing here?"
7,7,283,"00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:34,125",I thought I was gonna go backto my apartment. . .
7,7,284,"00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:39,207",. . .but I just felt like I reallycouldn't be alone tonight.
7,7,285,"00:17:44,652 --> 00:17:48,247",I was just wondering if I could maybestay here with you.
7,7,286,"00:17:48,492 --> 00:17:51,689","Just, I really feel like I needto be with family."
7,7,287,"00:17:53,612 --> 00:17:56,604","Our kids are gonna call herAunt Janice, aren't they?"

7,9,190,"00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:52,044  X1:135 X2:579 Y1:446 Y2:524",Maybe before we startwe should just get another one.
7,9,191,"00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:55,528  X1:153 X2:563 Y1:446 Y2:524","Perhaps like an airplane seat,or a beanbag chair!"

7,9,198,"00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:21,042  X1:109 X2:606 Y1:484 Y2:524",I would ring the bell to distract him.
7,9,199,"00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:24,767  X1:121 X2:596 Y1:446 Y2:524",Then I would knock the gun awaywith a Chinese throwing star.

8,17,94,"00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,439",- Where is that CD?- I'll save you time.
8,17,95,"00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,070","Two hundred CDs,not one of them in the right case."
8,17,96,"00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,397","Okay. No need to panic.Deep breaths, everyone."
8,17,97,"00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,030",We'll just have to put the CDsin their right cases.
8,17,98,"00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,318","If we do that, we shouldcome up with some kind of order."

8,17,104,"00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,073",Get him talking about something else.

8,17,116,"00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,475","Know what? If we're gonna make dinner,we're gonna have to leave."
8,17,117,"00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,237",So you have a big work problem?
8,17,118,"00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,430","Yeah. It's, uh..."
